## ðŸ§  PKM Archetypes: Know Thyself

Different people approach PKM differently. Knowing your default mode can help you work _with_ yourself, not against.

### Top-down vs. Bottom-up Thinkers 

|                | Top-down thinkers                           | Bottom-up thinkers                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Style**      | Start from abstract ideas, break them down  | Start from raw details, build up         |
| **Strengths**  | Structuring complexity, big-picture clarity | Grounded thinking, pattern discovery     |
| **Challenges** | Can be detached from reality                | Can drown in fragments without synthesis |

### Note-takers vs. Note-makers

|                | Note-takers                            | Note-makers                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Style**      | Capture information                    | Transform info into understanding  |
| **Strengths**  | Build rich references                  | Active learning, critical thinking |
| **Challenges** | Passive accumulation, rarely revisited | Time-consuming                     |

> [!tip] The goal is evolution: from taking â†’ to making â†’ to _living_ your notes.
