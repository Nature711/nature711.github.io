## ðŸªž Where I See Myself 

Iâ€™m someone whoâ€™s **deeply introspective** â€” constantly analyzing myself and the world around me.  
I genuinely enjoy exploring existential questions and writing my way through complexity. That kind of depth gives me meaning, even if it sometimes makes life feel heavier.

The part on **[[PKM#Good PKM vs. Bad PKM|Bad PKM]]** hits especially close:

- I collect more than I revisit.
- I hoard information out of **[[intellectual FOMO]]**.
- I assume what Iâ€™ve captured = what I know â€” and I overestimate my brainâ€™s capacity.

## ðŸ¤” My Archetype Reflection

- **[[PKM Archetypes#Top-down vs. Bottom-up Thinkers|Top-down vs. Bottom-up]]**: I see value in both. My goal is to stay aware of which mode Iâ€™m in â€” and choose intentionally.
    
- **[[PKM Archetypes#Note-takers vs. Note-makers|Note-maker vs. Note-taker]]**: Iâ€™m trying to shift toward _making_. To focus less on collection, more on connection and meaning.
    
- **[[PKM Archetypes#Writers|Writer]]**: Writing is where I think best. Itâ€™s both tool and therapy.
    
- **[[PKM Archetypes#Personal Dev Nerds vs. Project Managers|Personal Dev Nerd]]**: 100% me. But I know I need to balance growth with execution.


> [!quote] Maybe I need to channel a little more **Project Manager**:  
> Less obsessing, more doing. Less thinking, more finishing.
