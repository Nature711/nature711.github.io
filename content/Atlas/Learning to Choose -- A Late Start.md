## A Life of Decisions Made by Others

I recently had a really uncomfortable but important realization:  
I may have never truly made a decision for myself.

Almost every major turning point in my life — what school I went to, what major I studied, what country I moved to — was decided by my parents.

After middle school, they thought I wasn’t mentally strong enough for the Chinese education system, so they sent me to an international school. After high school, they thought CS had better prospects than natural science, so I gave up a full scholarship to HKU and went to NUS.  
Even during uni, when a guy confessed to me, they disapproved of his “reputation” so strongly that they even threatened to stop my living allowance if I didn’t cut contact with him. 

## The Cost of Outsourcing My Choices

In hindsight, all of these decisions turned out to be ***right*** — at least from *their point of view*.

So I started trusting them even more. Relying on them even more. I stopped learning how to choose for myself. I got used to *outsourcing* my decisions.

### The Underlying Problem

It wasn’t just about obedience. I think deep down, I was looking for a way to avoid responsibility.  
If I let someone else decide for me, then when things go wrong, at least I won’t have to bear the full emotional burden.  

But slowly, that mindset chipped away at my sense of autonomy. I became someone who didn’t know what I wanted — or even how to figure it out.

## Everyone’s Choosing—Except Me

Now I’m 23. I look around, and many of my peers have already started designing their own lives:  
some bought homes, some changed careers, some moved to new countries, some pursued masters degrees or just packed up to travel. Big decisions. Scary decisions. But _their_ decisions.  
I’m not sure they had all the answers — but at least they had the courage to choose.

And me? I’ve just been drifting.  
When everyone was applying for jobs, I applied too. When people said tech is dying, I panicked too. When someone said life is better back in China, I started reconsidering everything.  
Not because I had thought it through — but because I didn’t know how to think for myself.

I kept hoping someone would tell me what the “correct answer” was.  
But now, I realize that… no one can decide for me anymore.  
And I don't know how to decide for myself, either.

## From Good Student to Lost Adult

In school, I was good at following structure. Exams, grades, rankings — I knew how to win that game.  
But life is different. There’s no scoreboard.  
Your “KPI” is whatever you define it to be. Your goals aren’t assigned — you have to set them.  
And I’ve come to realize: I’m not very good at that.

I thought I was a great planner. But maybe… I’ve never really planned _my own_ life.  
Just followed whatever path seemed safest, most praised, least risky.

But now, I’ve hit a wall. I don’t trust myself to choose, because I’ve never practiced choosing.  
And I’ve been afraid to take full responsibility for my life.

But if I don’t learn to choose now — then who will?

### Growing up 

Maybe this is part of growing up.  
Not having the answers, but still moving forward.  
Not looking for the perfect path, but learning how to walk whichever one I choose.
