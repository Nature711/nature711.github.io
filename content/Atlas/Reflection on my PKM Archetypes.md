## 🪞 Where I See Myself 

I’m someone who’s **deeply introspective** — constantly analyzing myself and the world around me.  
I genuinely enjoy exploring existential questions and writing my way through complexity. That kind of depth gives me meaning, even if it sometimes makes life feel heavier.

The part on **[[PKM#Good PKM vs. Bad PKM|Bad PKM]]** hits especially close:

- I collect more than I revisit.
- I hoard information out of **[[intellectual FOMO]]**.
- I assume what I’ve captured = what I know — and I overestimate my brain’s capacity.

## 🤔 My Archetype Reflection

- **[[PKM Archetypes#Top-down vs. Bottom-up Thinkers|Top-down vs. Bottom-up]]**: I see value in both. My goal is to stay aware of which mode I’m in — and choose intentionally.
    
- **[[PKM Archetypes#Note-takers vs. Note-makers|Note-maker vs. Note-taker]]**: I’m trying to shift toward _making_. To focus less on collection, more on connection and meaning.
    
- **[[PKM Archetypes#Writers|Writer]]**: Writing is where I think best. It’s both tool and therapy.
    
- **[[PKM Archetypes#Personal Dev Nerds vs. Project Managers|Personal Dev Nerd]]**: 100% me. But I know I need to balance growth with execution.
