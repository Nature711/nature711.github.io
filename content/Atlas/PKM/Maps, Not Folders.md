## 🗺️ Maps, Not Folders

In this garden, you’ll notice that the folder structure is neat and clear —  
but you’re **not supposed to dig through folders** to find notes.

Because folders are for storage.  
**Maps are for navigation.**

## 🧱 Why Folders Still Matter

I do organize notes into folders like `Atlas/`, `Efforts/`, `Calendar/`, etc.  
This keeps the garden **tidy on the backend**, and helps me:
- maintain publishing logic (e.g. what gets shown vs. hidden)
- separate evergreen notes from work projects
- structure images, templates, and private content cleanly

But the folders aren't meant to be "browsed".

## 🧭 How Maps Make Navigation Human

Instead of dumping notes into giant folders or relying on tags alone, I build **Map Notes** — curated, high-signal entry points.

Each map:
- groups related ideas (PKM, System Design, Infra Projects)
- highlights the **mental structure** behind the notes
- acts like a **Table of Contents** — but alive, editable, and evolving

That’s how ideas connect.  
That’s how exploration becomes intuitive.

## 🌱 Why I Love This Approach

When I follow a map, I’m not just *retrieving information* — I’m ***traversing meaning***.

> Notes are nodes.  
> Maps are trails.  
> Thinking happens in the in-between.

This is what makes a digital garden different from a static wiki or file dump.
