> I’m confused because I haven’t found my *anchor*. 
> I have so many interests — LLMs, finance, tennis, music, journalling & reflecting...
> Meanwhile, I have a new job where I need to close a big gap on *backend fundamentals*.
> I don't know where to start or where each path leads, so I just jump between things every 10 minutes. 
> I end up doing *nothing* and just feeling extremely anxious and restless. That’s the worst part — I have all this energy, but I’m not *channeling* it, so it just feels wasted. 
> How do I get out of this loop and stop faking productivity? I want to focus on the things that actually matter and *build* meaningful things.

It's like being pulled in so many directions at once, with so much energy but **nowhere** to *channel* it. That restlessness and anxiety you're describing often comes from not having a clear "why" behind your choices, so every option feels equally urgent and equally dismissible.

Here's what might help you break the cycle:

**Start with what's actually causing you pain or excitement right now.** Not what "should" matter, but what genuinely bothers you or lights you up. You mentioned backend fundamentals at work—is that gap causing real problems for you? Is there a project you can't contribute to, or do you feel sidelined in conversations? Or is it more abstract worry? Similarly, which of these interests makes you lose track of time when you engage with it, versus which ones feel like you "should" care about them?

**Pick one anchor based on concrete outcomes, not learning.** Instead of "learn RAG," try "build something small with RAG that solves a problem I actually have." Instead of "get better at backend," try "be able to confidently review and contribute to the authentication system at work within a month." Vague learning goals feel infinite and never done. Concrete outcomes have endpoints and give you real feedback about whether you're making progress.

**Time-box exploration ruthlessly.** Give yourself structured "mess around" time—maybe 30 minutes a day or a few hours on weekends—where you can sample whatever interests you. But outside that window, you commit to your anchor. This satisfies the curiosity itch without letting it derail everything.

**Notice what compounds.** After a few weeks of focusing on one thing, check: is this building on itself? Are you getting noticeably better, making connections, opening doors? Or does it feel like you're starting from zero every time? The things that compound are usually the ones worth doubling down on.

The hardest part is accepting that choosing one thing means not choosing others _right now_. Not forever—just right now. You can learn about LLMs next quarter, or invest more seriously when you have clearer financial goals, or dive into music when your backend skills feel solid. But trying to do everything simultaneously guarantees you'll do nothing well and feel terrible about it.

What's one concrete thing you could commit to for the next two weeks that would either solve a real problem or significantly change your day-to-day experience?
