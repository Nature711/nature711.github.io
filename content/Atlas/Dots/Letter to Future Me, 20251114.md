*Hey Nature,*

How are you doing? Where are you now? Are you feeling more grounded? A little closer to the life you truly want?

I don’t know if you still remember how lost I’ve been.

For a long time, I couldn’t even picture what the next few weeks or months would look like. Everything about the future felt abstract. Vague. Like I didn’t have enough information to decide anything — so I kept postponing, kept waiting.

---

That was the debt I unknowingly accumulated over the past year. Because I was always thinking:

> “It’s okay, I’ll figure it out eventually. Just take it slow, give it time.”

But now, looking back, I realize I wasn’t figuring anything out — I was stagnating.  
Maybe even moving backwards.

I thought I was “taking it slow,” but really, I was just drifting. 
And that terrifies me. 

That’s when I started to understand:

> Some things don’t just get better with time.
> Time alone doesn't fix everything.

The past year has taught me: 

> Freedom without grounding doesn't soothe me — it scatters me.

I’ve started to admit that some parts of my life — the job, the rhythm I was living in, and some of my mindsets — just weren’t right for me.

I’m someone who finds peace in _**structure**_, and clarity in _**rhythm**_ —  
not rigid plans, but something steady enough to hold me.

---

So I’ve been making changes —
Reaching out, facing what I don’t know, and letting go of what no longer serves me, however painfully that needs to be. 

I’m still unsure. But at least I’m _moving_. 

As for that “*lost year*”? 
Maybe it wasn’t a failure. 
Maybe it was just a *beautiful detour*, like chasing a butterfly through the rain — brief, vivid, and real.
And now, I’ve returned to the path that feels like mine.

So, future me —

If you’ve done all that — congrats. I’m proud of you.

But I know you’ve probably met new challenges too. That’s just life.

And if you’re feeling lost again, I hope this letter reminds you:  

You’ve been here before.  
You stood back up before.  
**You can do it again.**

We’re on our way. I’m rooting for you.

— From the version of you who’s still a little messy, but finally moving again
