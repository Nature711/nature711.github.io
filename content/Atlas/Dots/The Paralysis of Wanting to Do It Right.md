Lately, I feel like I'm just... stuck.  
Like I’m so obsessed with optimizing **everything** that I end up doing **nothing** at all.

### The Habit That Once Helped

Take something as simple as writing a gratitude journal.  

So many friends have told me I should try it — that it might help me stop spiraling, stop complaining about life, stop feeling so bad about myself all the time.  
And the thing is... I _have_ done it before. And yeah, it _did_ help.  

Back then I’d just write down 3 things each day:
- something I was grateful for;
- something that made me happy;
- something I appreciated about myself.  

Nothing fancy. Just simple. But looking back now — those entries actually made me feel really grounded.  

### The Spiral of Overthinking

But at some point I stopped.  
And now that I’m trying to start again... I just can’t.

It’s not that I _don’t_ want to.  
It’s that the moment I think about writing, **a thousand questions and possibilities flood my brain**.

Should I write by hand? I actually love handwriting — it slows me down in a good way.  
But now I have this whole digital garden setup, and I want everything centralized and searchable and linkable.  
So I start thinking — okay, maybe I can *handwrite* first, then *digitize* later?  
But that sounds like extra work, and I start spiraling again.

Even when I finally convinced myself to start writing, I then get stuck thinking:  
What format should I use?  
Should I just write three bullet points?  
Or should I explain what happened that day for context? ...

And once again, I give up.

It’s like I can’t _just write_.  
My brain turns everything into a system.  
And it’s **exhausting**.

### What I Actually Want

But what I actually want is so simple.
I want to write something that brings me **peace** — not something that becomes a whole workflow, or something I have to optimize later.  
I want to go back to how it used to feel: *simple*, *quiet*, *grounding*.

But somehow, I’ve made even gratitude… complicated.

I don’t know exactly when or how I became like this.  
But I miss that version of me who could sit down, write three honest lines, and feel okay.  
I want to find my way back to her.
