## Goal

> [!important] Goal of this framework

## Step 1: Make an Initial Lean

### Purpose

To create an _internal anchor_ before other people influence me, which prevents: 

- Being swayed by every new opinion
- Flip-flopping
- “I don’t know what I want”

### What to do

Write 1–2 sentences:

> **“My current lean is ____.  
> Because the main reason is ____.”

### End Result

I can start with _my own voice_, not others’ → stabilizing the entire decision.

---
## Step 2: Use Your 8 Universal Life Criteria

### Purpose

To give myself a clear, structured framework for evaluating options, which prevents:

- Overthinking
- Emotional chaos & decision overwhelm
- Conflicting advice
    
### What to do

Score each criterion from [[8 Universal Life Decision Criteria]]:

> [!tip] CRITERIA
> 
> 1. Core Values Alignment
> 2. Emotional Energy & Well-being
> 3. Long-Term Identity Alignment
> 4. Learning & Growth Potential
> 5. Relationship / People Environment
> 6. Practical & Financial Sustainability
> 7. Opportunity Cost & Regret Profile
> 8. Stability vs Risk Balance
    
### End Result

I know what ACTUALLY matters to _me_ → decision becomes grounded, consistent, and repeatable.

---
## Step 3: Gather Limited, Structured Perspectives (Not Instructions)

### Purpose

To get insights without losing my autonomy or clarity, which prevents:

- Confusion from too many voices
- Outsourcing decisions
- Emotional dependency on authority figures

### What to do

Ask **3–5 people max**, using the new question format:

> **“Based on these 8 criteria, how would you see this?”**

Map their input back to my criteria — not their preferences.

### End Result

I collect _useful data_, not controlling opinions.  

---
## Step 4: Apply the 2R Rule

### Purpose

To break perfectionism and take action with confidence, which prevents:

- Decision paralysis
- Waiting for 100% certainty
- Endless loops of “what if?”

### What to do

#### R1 — 60% Rational Confidence

If one option aligns better with my criteria → it’s enough.

#### R2 — 40% Regret Tolerance

Ask:

> **“If this goes wrong, can I handle it?”**

If yes → proceed.

### End Result

A solid, adult-level decision: not perfect, but *clear, stable, and actionable*.

---
## Step 5: Lock the Decision

### Purpose

To stop yourself from undoing the decision emotionally, which prevents:

- Spiraling
- Re-opening the decision every hour
- Letting new opinions shake you

### What to do

Lock it for a time window:

- 3–7 days (medium decisions)
- 1–2 weeks (big decisions)

During this window:
- No new opinions / re-analysis
- Only execution

### End Result

Nervous system calms.  
Decision stabilizes.  
Stop self-sabotaging.

---
## Step 6: Make the Decision Right

### Purpose

To turn the chosen path into a strong trajectory, which prevents: 

- Regret
- Second-guessing
- “Did I choose the best?” anxiety

### What to do

Immediately write:

- 2 ways to *maximize upside*
- 2 ways to *reduce downside*
- 2 actions to *commit* to this direction
    
### End Result

My decision gains momentum and becomes *meaningful* —  
because I ***shape the path***, instead of waiting for perfection.
