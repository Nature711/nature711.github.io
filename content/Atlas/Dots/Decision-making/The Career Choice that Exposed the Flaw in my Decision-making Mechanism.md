## Realization: I Don’t Really Make My Own Decisions

These weeks of job searching uncovered something deeper than just “which offer to take.”  
I realized that *I don’t actually have a stable decision-making mechanism of my own*.

I tend to:
- Ask many people for advice
- **Over-consume** inputs from friends, mentors, and even AIs
- Shift my thinking based on the **last authority figure** I talked to
- Lose my own sense of direction whenever **new information** arrives
    
I used to comfort myself by thinking this is “hearing to both sides of the story” (i.e., 兼听则明), but the truth is:  
**I wasn’t synthesizing perspectives — I was outsourcing my judgment.**

There was no anchor.  
Just constant oscillation.

## The Career Confusion That Exposed It

Looking back over the past year, the pattern is everywhere.

### 1. Entering my current role without true deliberation

I picked Ops/Infra because:

- my internship experience happened to fit,
- it felt “less competitive,”
- I believed “just get in first; I can always switch later.”

But the truth is:  
I didn’t choose. I _slid_ into it.

And once inside, I used everyone else’s voices to justify staying even as I felt increasingly stuck.

### 2. Staying far longer than I should have

I hated the fragmented onboarding, the chaos, the cost-management work that drained me.  
But instead of acting, I let others *pacify* me:

> “It just takes time, you will get used to it.”

> “This role is experience-based; it will get better.”

> “You just need to accumulate.”
    
And I trusted them more than I trusted myself.  
Months passed, and nothing changed.  
I was stagnant, anxious, and drifting.

### My turning point wasn’t from _me_, but from someone else

When my good friend suddenly got into FAANG — that jolted me awake.  
Not because I decided to take control, but because I *reacted to someone else’s momentum*.

I jumped into interview prep the same way:  
not out of inner conviction,  
but out of fear of being left behind.

### The Offer Stage: Where My Lack of Anchor Became Impossible to Ignore

This is where everything became painfully obvious.

#### Every opinion shakes me

One friend says: “It’s a great offer; just accept.”
I calm down instantly.

Another says: “You should negotiate more.”
And suddenly I’m planning escalation strategies, timing, risks…

A colleague says: “This role at Company X is amazing, you should consider continuing.”
And instantly my mind flips back into chaos:

- Should I interview more?
- Should I take a risk?
- Should I join core ML infra instead?
    
I have a new plan every ten minutes — depending on the last person I talked to.

> I realized I don’t have **opinions**.  
> I only have **reactions**.

#### I keep seeking “the right voice to tell me what to do”

Friends, mentors, different AIs…  
I keep searching for a verdict I can rely on.

Sometimes I even want someone authoritative to say:

> “Yes, this is the correct path. Go.”

Just so I can feel safe.

#### I’m scared that I am the one who must make the final call

Because if it's my decision,  
then I am also responsible for the outcome.

And responsibility *terrifies* me.

## What’s Actually Behind All This?

### I fear making the “wrong choice”

So I delay, outsource, gather opinions endlessly —  
hoping someone else can reduce my risk for me.

### I don’t trust my own evaluation

I don’t believe my thinking is enough.  
I think others always know better.  
So I keep replacing my judgment with theirs.

### My identity is too easily shaped by external voices

If people tell me SRE is better, I lean that way.  
If people say backend is more prestigious, I lean that way.  
I do not yet have a stable sense of:

- what energizes me
- what matters to me
- what trade-offs I’m willing to make
