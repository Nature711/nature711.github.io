## Choose to stop hesitating and commit

- Indecision drains energy and creates anxiety
- Once I choose a path, I can fully invest in it and shape the outcome
- Early-career decisions are **reversible** and **discoverable**, not permanent

## Money is not my priority right now

- I'm not paying debt or supporting family
- $22k difference is "nice to have" but not life-changing
- I need to think **long-term**, not just immediate salary

## The Proven Path Reduces Risk

- Clear track record: Shopee → ByteDance/Google
- This is a **1-year stepping stone**, not my final destination
- Following a proven path lets me focus on performing well, not gambling on uncertainty

## Breadth > Depth at My Stage

- **Current experience**: Infra/cloud at Hoyoverse (1 month left to learn more from teammates)
- **After Shopee**: Product backend experience
- **Exploration**: I'm still discovering what I'm truly good at
- **Result in 1 year**: Both infra AND product experience = I'll know which direction truly fits me
- **If I choose wrong**: I can pivot back to infra at ByteDance/Airwallex with mature environments

## The Problem of Premature Specialization

- Airwallex’s deeper infra path is attractive, but premature for my current stage.
- Infra depth feels “cool” and “prestigious,” but:
	- I am not fully committed to that identity yet
	- Deep specialization now may limit early-career exploration
	- I want to understand product engineering before narrowing my path
	- I can always return to infra later when I'm more confident

## More Time to Prepare for Future

- Shopee gives me space to explore and grow
- I can prepare for ByteDance/Google applications while learning
- Goal: Grow at Shopee → jump directly to FAANG (or via ByteDance if needed)

## My Commitment

✅ **I choose Shopee.**

✅ **I will stop second-guessing this decision.**

✅ **I will spend my energy optimizing this path and proving it was right.**

✅ **I will do my best to create impact, learn, and grow at Shopee.**


> [!important] Final Decision Statement
> I choose Shopee because it aligns with who I am today, supports how I grow best, gives me space to explore product SWE, and positions me on a proven pathway toward top-tier companies.
>  I will make Shopee work, grow as much as possible, and use this experience to clarify my direction. I will not waste energy on regret - only on growth.

## My Action Plan

### Next 1 Month (Hoyoverse Notice Period)

- Learn as much as possible from teammates about infra/cloud
- Maximize my remaining time to deepen infra knowledge
- Prepare mentally for transition to product backend

### First Year / Half Year at Shopee

- Focus on learning product backend development
- Build strong relationships with team and manager
- Create measurable impact with user-facing features
- Document achievements for future ByteDance/Google applications
- Explore whether product work truly suits me

### Afterwards

- Decide: Do I prefer product backend or infrastructure?
- Apply to ByteDance/Google with clear direction
- **If I want infra**: I can pivot back with Hoyoverse + product experience showing breadth
- **If I want product**: Shopee experience directly supports this path

## Things to remember when I feel lost

❌ "Did I make the wrong choice?"
✅ **"There is no wrong choice. I'm exploring and learning. Both paths work."**

> When a choice makes us hesitate this much, it usually means the options are actually very close. If one were clearly better, we wouldn’t be struggling at all.

❌ "I should have taken the higher salary at Airwallex"
✅ **"Money isn't urgent for me. I'm optimizing for long-term growth and exploration."**

❌ "What if Airwallex was better?"
✅ **"I chose the proven path and breadth. I'm committed to making Shopee work. If I want infra later, I can still pivot."**

❌ "I'm falling behind by not doing deep infra work"
✅ **"I'm gaining breadth. In 1 year, I'll have both infra + product experience. That's valuable."**
