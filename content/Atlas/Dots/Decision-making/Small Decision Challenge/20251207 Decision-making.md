## Zachary 

It must be a fruitful weekend for you to analyze all these.
I like that you put your thought process down into writing.

Some questions for you to think abt:
1) Salary difference - what would the additional money means to you? Buy a bigger house faster? Do you have a strong financial need?
2) Role / job scope - you can also review it based on the impact of your work. This is how FAANG companies evaluate your suitability.
	- Impact = how many customers will benefit from the work you are doing.
3) Manager - for both hiring manager, which one gives you a better “vibe” and that you can learn more from?

1. Money is not my top priority, as I'm not paying debt or supporting family. It's nice to have more, but not life-changing for me now. Long-term growth matters more to me than short-term salary difference. 
2. For impact, I think infra depth feels "cool" and a bit... prestigious (as it's more challenging?). But to be honest, I'm that kind of person who wants to see clear and direct result quickly, so I think probably product impact may gives me a greater sense of achievement and also help me build better narratives. 
	- but I can always pivot back my (limited) infra / cloud experiences at HoYo if I want
3. To be honest, both manager didn't left much impression to me haha. But since Shopee team is more diverse and all based in SG, the overall vibe may be better?

So yes, I will commit to choose Shopee. I will *stop second-guessing* and **start optimizing** the path along -- 
- next 1 month: learn as much as possible from teammates about infra/cloud; maximizing the remaining time to deepen infra knowledge
- first 1 yr at Shopee: focus on learning product backend development; create measurable impact with user-facing features
- after 1 yr / along the way: reflecting on what I truly enjoy; decide the next steps...

I'm so glad that I had the chance to be exposed to this kind of decision at my early career. That's such a valuable lession! I will share more during our upcoming session 😊

For 2) -- Suggest u make it quantifiable - so that you can articulate your impact when u apply for FAANG in the future

Congrats!
Both options are good and most important is -- what we do after we make the decision

You will be tempted to have -- decision remorse 
And regret a bit abt why u did not choose the other options ..

My challenge for you is 
- after u join the company, focus on the good things and learning points that u are receiving at that moment with the new company
- minimize comparison & decision remorse
