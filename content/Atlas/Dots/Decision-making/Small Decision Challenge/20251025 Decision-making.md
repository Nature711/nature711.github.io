A small decision that I made without regret: 
I said yes to a last-minute lunch invite from a friend at Apple, even though I’d originally planned to cook at home and visit another friend later.

Why I chose it:
I'm job hunting, and this was a good chance to connect, with low effort & high potential value. I reminded myself it wasn’t a big disruption, and I can still visit my other friend afterwards. So I made the call in under a minute.

How it went:
Really glad I went. Met not just my friend but also someone new he introduced. We had a great chat, good food, and I left feeling more connected and recharged. Still made it to my afternoon plan too.

What I learned:
Not every plan needs to be rigid. Quick, intentional choices can open up more than I expect, and I don’t need to overthink everything.
