I’ve been thinking more about the “informed decision-making muscle” you’ve been encouraging me to develop, and I realized something about the kind of decisions I’m facing now.

Previously, the things that occupied my headspace were quite small and low-stakes, e.g., whether to go for lunch with a friend, which place to travel to... simple pros and cons. They weren’t trivial to me at the time, but they were mostly day-to-day choices that didn’t carry long-term consequences.

But recently, my entire mental bandwidth has been taken over by much heavier decisions:  
- evaluating different job directions with very different responsibilities,  
- navigating timing, compensation, bonus trade-offs, uncertainty, and negotiation,
- and trying to align everything with my long-term career trajectory rather than just short-term gain. 

The difficulty feels completely different, since these decisions actually affect my life in the next few years. It’s daunting, but also exciting in a way, because for the first time in a long while, I feel like I’m taking on real responsibility for myself. Instead of letting things “just happen” to me, I’m genuinely trying to choose with intention, and make the decision right.

Of course, sometimes the stress gets overwhelming. So I remind myself of what you told me: the difference between _making the right decision_ and _making the decision right_. It helps me reframe my thinking. A career isn’t a ladder to climb, but a journey to design, and it’s not like choosing one job “locks in” my fate forever. The real power lies in what I do _after_ I make the choice -- how I grow, adapt, and shape the path ahead.

I'm still in the middle of a lot of uncertainty, but keeping these in mind make me feel a little less frightening and a lot more empowering.
