This week I’ve been consciously trying to practice decision-making. One small example: I spent way too long hesitating over how to restart my gratitude journal (handwritten or digital? structured or freeform? how to store it long-term, etc.) and totally fell into analysis paralysis.

But I reminded myself that not every decision needs to be optimized, and sometimes it’s just about taking action. So I grabbed a simple pen and notebook and just started. And honestly it felt great. The moment the pen touched paper, I felt that ease again. I'm trying to not over-complicate things and acknowledge that not all things need to be "perfectly planned" before getting started.

Also I’ve been thinking about the [10–10–10 rule](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-10-10-10-rule-advice-on-life-more) you shared, and trying to apply it to a decision I’ve been struggling with: where to travel at the end of the year. Seems that Each destination has its pros and cons, and I’ve stuck into endless research once again. 
I'm trying to tell myself that some decisions aren’t life-altering or irreversible. I’m still learning how to define what's "good enough" and not chase the “perfect” choice. Hopefully I’ll make the call soon haha, but either way, it’s helping me build that decision-making muscle.
