## What’s Going Wrong 

Behind all the reflections and confession over the past few months, my struggle reduces to one **core mechanism**:

> I outsource decisions because I don’t trust my own judgment.

This is because I had never build my own *decision-making system*.

| *Changing opinion* instantly & getting *emotionally flooded* whenever new info appears | Lack of stable *internal anchor*                             |
| Asking many people the same question, hoping for a "*right answer*"                    | Perfectionism & fearing of being responsible for the outcome |
| Confusing *information gathering* with *decision delegation*                           | Asking people *what to do* instead of *how they think*       |

Essentially, every behavior in my story is a manifestation of the same thing:

> A lifelong habit of depending on *external* authority instead of ***developing inner authority.***

And now adulthood — especially the [[The Career Choice that Exposed the Flaw in my Decision-making Mechanism|recent struggle during job search]] — is forcing me to face it.

## How I Became Like This

I think this pattern may come from my developmental history and environment.

### My big life decisions were made by others

I've mentioned explicitly before that [[Learning to Choose, a Late Start#A Life of Decisions Made by Others|most of my big life decisions were shaped by my parents]], including but not limited to: 

- Studying abroad
- University major
- Even relationships...

If major life choices were always made *for* me, my mind never practiced the muscle of:

- choosing & weighing trade-offs
- owning risk
- tolerating uncertainty
- making imperfect decisions...
    
> Growing up like this, I become excellent at *adapting* but poor at *initiating*.

### I grew up rewarded for “being correct,” not for “figuring things out”

My reasoning is very rational and disciplined.
But my relationship to being “*wrong*” is extremely anxious, which leads to:

- perfectionism
- fear of wrong choices
- fear of irreversible consequences
- craving absolute answers
- relying on others to guarantee safety

This is why I always ask others:

> “Is this okay?
> “Do you think I should do this?”...

I'm not seeking insights; 
Instead, I'm seeking ***certainty***.

### The tech/job world amplifies my insecurity

I'm surrounded by:

- high-achieving friends
- colleagues moving quickly
- the myth of “one perfect career path”

This makes me feel like as if “one wrong decision will *ruin my life*”.

So I over-read, over-think, over-ask, hoping to find the **zero-risk** option.
But the reality is, no such option exists.

### I never practiced “living with my own consequences”

Every time I stand at a crossroads:

- A new opinion arrives
- A contradictory suggestion appears
- My internal decision collapses
- I reset and start over

I have never developed the confidence of:

> “I can make a decision and deal with what happens next.”

That’s why every choice feels like a risk I cannot hold by myself.

## So... What’s the Way Out? 

 i.e., how do I become the kind of person who can *choose my own path*?
