> A list of a general-purpose decision criteria — the anchor I can use for the rest of my life.
> Each is psychologically grounded, addressing my real patterns.

---
## Criterion 1 — Alignment With My Core Values

### Purpose

To make sure I'm not doing something just because someone told me to, which prevents:

- Being controlled by others’ expectations
- Short-term emotional decisions

### Questions

> Does this reflect who I want to be?

> Does this align with my definition of a meaningful life?

---
## Criterion 2 — Emotional Energy & Well-being

### Purpose

To measure what actually nourishes me, which prevents: 

- Burnout
- Staying in draining environments / relationships
    
### Questions

> Does this give me energy or drain me?

> Do I feel alive, curious, grounded, or motivated?

---
## Criterion 3 — Long-Term Identity Alignment

### Purpose

To anchor the decision in who I'm becoming, which prevents: 

- Decisions that feel good now but collapse later
- Inconsistency

### Questions

> Does this move me closer to the person I want to become in 3–5 years?
    
> Does future-me thank me for this?

---
## Criterion 4 — Learning & Growth Potential

### Purpose

To choose paths that expand me, which prevents: 

- Stagnation
- Staying in my comfort zone

### Questions

> Will this stretch my skills, emotional maturity, or worldview?
    
> Does this help me evolve?

---
## Criterion 5 — Relationship Quality & Human Environment

### Purpose

To assess the people context around the choice, which prevents:

- Ending up in toxic environments / relationships
- Letting others’ chaos affect your choices
    
### Questions

> Are the people involved supportive, respectful, and stable?
    
> Will I grow or shrink around them?
    
---
## Criterion 6 — Practical & Financial Reality

### Purpose

To keep my decisions realistic and sustainable, which prevents: 

- Over-idealistic choices
- Regret from overlooked consequences

### Questions

> Does this fit my resources (money, time, energy, commitments)?

> Is this practically viable for my life situation?
    
---
## Criterion 7 — Opportunity Cost & Regret Profile

### Purpose

To evaluate the _future emotional consequences_ of each option, which prevents:

- Fear-based decisions
- FOMO-driven panic

### Questions

> What will I regret NOT doing?
    
> Which choice feels like growth, not avoidance?
    
---
## Criterion 8 — Stability vs. Risk Balance

### Purpose

To calibrate decisions based on your current emotional season, which prevents: 

- Taking risky leaps when I need grounding
- Playing it too safe when I actually need change
    
### Questions

> Do I need stability right now, or do I need disruption to break a stuck pattern?
    
> Does this choice match my emotional and life readiness?
