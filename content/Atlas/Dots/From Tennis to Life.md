## Background

### The Triggering Event

- Had a **deep conversation** with a former colleague during lunch

- We originally connected through **tennis**; gradually became closer through playing together

- About him:
    - Improved **extremely fast** in tennis (from beginner to comparable level within ~1 year)
    - ~10 yrs of working experiences in backend / distributed systems
    - Strong reflective ability (INTP)
        
- Last year, I gave him a handwritten Christmas letter
    - He received it very seriously
    - Explicitly expressed how moved he was（觉得我是一个很【温暖】的人）
        
- This created a strong sense of **mutual recognition**

### Core Emotional Insight: Being Truly Understood

- What really touched me: 
    - Being **genuinely understood & seen**（被理解、被看见）
        
- I realized I deeply value:
    - Clear emotional feedback
    - Intellectual and reflective resonance（思维共鸣）
    - Depth over surface-level interaction（深度交流）
        
- The key experience was:    
    - Sending a signal → receiving a **clear echo**, not silence

## The Discussion

### Rethinking Self-Exploration: Beyond Pure Thinking

#### His approach to self-understanding

- Uses **action and embodiment** to explore himself:
    - Tennis
    - Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu（巴西柔术：【用身体下棋】）
    - Vocal
    - Ice skating...
        
- Sees these as ways of connecting mind and body（身心连接）

#### Reflecting on my existing approach

- Heavily centered on:
    - Writing
    - Analysis
    - Endless self-reflection
        
- Limitations I observed:
    - Easy to fall into **overthinking loops**
    - More thinking → more confusion
    - Minimal behavioral breakthrough
    - High emotional cost, low practical value（只有内耗，没有行动 / 改变）
    
#### Key realization

- Self-understanding ≠ only cognitive introspection
- Thinking and language have **inherent limits**
	- Related:  [[The Boundary of Language]]

### Learning Philosophy: First Principles and Anchors

#### His view on tennis

- Tennis reduced to its **essence**:
    - Racket + angle + speed
    - Sending the ball to a spot unreachable by the opponent

> "用 球拍 将球以一定的 角度 + 速度 打到对手无法触及的位置“

- All other concepts *expand* from this:
    - Tactics
    - Positioning
    - Body coordination
    - Kinetic chain
    - Physics and physiology...
        
- There is always a clear **anchor**
    
#### My resonance with this approach

- I always love to understand the *why*, not just the *what / how*
        
- I noticed, however, that I often:
    - Focus on making things work
    - Accept results without understanding principles
    - Know the what without the why（**知其然不知其所以然**）
        
- Although slower:
    - Principle-based understanding feels **truly mine**
    - More *stable* and *transferable*

## Further Reflections 

### A Major Insight on Motivation Sources

#### Observing others

- Many people’s motivation comes from *internal*:
    - Desire to grow
    - Curiosity about themselves / internal exploration
        
- Their effort feels **self-sustaining**, not forced

#### Observing myself

- My motivation, however, often comes from *external*:
    - Crushes / emotional projection
    - Peer pressure / comparison
        
- Pattern:
    - Short-term intensity (the *burst*)
    - Strong but *unstable*
    - Highly dependent on uncontrollable factors

#### Reflections

- External motivation is not “*wrong*”
- But **over-reliance** on it is *not sustainable*
- What I want:
    - Shift from **external → internal motivation**
    - More **agency** & long-term stability
    - Health & sustainable

### Thinking Ownership in the Age of AI

#### Self-doubt

- Sometimes I feel:
    - I’m not smart enough
    - Certain problems are beyond my reasoning capacity
        
#### Deeper diagnosis

- Real issue: **over-outsourcing** thinking to AI（把思考过度外包给AI）
        
- Pattern:
    - Question → ask AI immediately
    - Fast answer, *minimal internal reasoning*
        
- Long-term risk:
    - **Weakened** independent thinking
    - Growing **impatience** with uncertainty

#### New intention

> Reclaim **thinking ownership（思维主权）**
    
- Allow:
    - Slowness
    - Incomplete reasoning
    - Temporary confusion
        
- In the AI era:
    - Ordinary people use AI
    - Exceptional people still **think beyond AI**

> [!quote] 工具依赖的本质是*认知外包 (cognitive outsourcing)*。当我们把判断和思考的权力交给算法，*短期*获得了*效率*，*长期*却在削弱自己的*决策肌肉*。真正的危险不是使用AI，而是失去对AI输出的*批判性审视能力 (critical thinking)*。聪明的做法是把AI当作思考的*起点而非终点*，用它来**扩展可能性边界**，而不是替代深度思考本身。

## Directional Shift Going Forward

> [!important] From → To
> - External stimulation → internal drive（外界刺激 → 自我驱动）
> - Pure cognition → action + experience（纯思考 → 行动 + 体验）
> - Fast answers → deep reasoning（急于求成 → 深度求索）

> [!tips] Goal is not instant excellence, but:
> - Greater autonomy（自主 / 掌控）
> - Stronger grounding（扎实基础）
> - Sustainable growth（可持续成长）

> Moving from being someone who is easily ignited by the outside world,  
> to someone who can generate fire from within.
