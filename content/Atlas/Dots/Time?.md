Every time I scroll through my photo album, it feels like falling into a rabbit hole — fully immersed in the memory, trying to imagine what state of mind I was in back then.

And I often get this strange feeling —

> Rationally, I know those things happened, that I had lived through them;
> But emotionally, it almost feels like they never did.

## Time, Rearranged

It’s not that I’ve forgotten; it's more like a kind of *disconnection*.  
Like I know that was _me_, but at the same time, it doesn’t really feel like _me_ anymore. （跟过去的自己【脱钩】）

Everything is clear, but at the same time **distant** and **unfamiliar**, like there’s a thin layer of fog in between. 

And it doesn’t even take that long —
Sometimes it’s just things from a month ago, or even a few weeks ago, and they already feel quite far away.  

It’s not like something dramatic happened every day. Most days were just… days.  
But somehow, time feels *stretched* in retrospect, and those moments already belong to a past version of me.

## From There, to Here

And because of that, a lot of things that felt huge and incredibly hard at the time, now seem *surprisingly light*.  
It’s not that they didn’t matter; it’s just that I’m **no longer standing in the same place from which I saw the world back then**.  
Looking back, everything feels calmer and flatter. 

> 回看射雕处，千里暮云平

So perhaps, the things that feel impossible to get through right now — the anxiety, the frustration, the things that feel stuck...
Maybe in a few months, or even just weeks, I’ll look back and realize they’ve already been left behind, stored in an **older version of myself.**

## Moving Forward

Of course, as the lyrics go —

> There’s always going to be another mountain, and I’m always going to make it move.  

You get over one thing, and there’s always another one waiting.

This is a journey without an endpoint. 
Maybe the only way is to simply to keep going, one step at a time, and see what life will bring.
