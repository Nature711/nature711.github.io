> [!TLDR] TL;DR
> I used to approach socializing from a place of *inferiority*—trying to please, compensate, and “repay” others.  
> Now I’m learning that healthy socializing is about ***mutual value*** that comes from who I am, not what I give.  
> The focus is *shifting inward*: becoming a grounded, growing, self-respecting person whose presence itself carries value.


Recently, I came across an idea on socialization:  

> Social interaction is, at its core, **an exchange of value**.  

This reframed a long-standing pattern in me.

## 😟 A Feeling of Inferiority

For a long time, my social mindset had been shaped by a persistent belief:  

> “Others are always more capable, more knowledgeable, more worthy. I’m the one who needs to catch up.”
> （别人都是“大佬”，我是抱着请教的心态来跟他们打交道的，理所应当该在物质上多付出一些）

Whenever I asked for advice or guidance, I felt as if I was “taking” something—and therefore needed to compensate. 
My way of reciprocating was preparing gifts, writing cards, and doing small favors.

These gestures were sincere, but they were driven by **anxiety** —  a sense that I owed people something simply for their time or wisdom.

This created a cycle of **self-doubt**:  

> “Did I give enough? Should I do more? Am I indebted to this person?” 

Which spiraled into pressure and guilt.

## 🌱 A Clearer View of “Value”

Understanding value as something broader—and more natural—changed my perspective.

Value is not material repayment.  
Value is what I _bring by being who I am_:

> [!info]+ My Values:
> - curiosity
>     
> - thoughtful conversation
>     
> - sincerity and emotional clarity
>     
> - a stable and respectful presence
>     
> - my way of thinking, learning, and observing the world

These qualities already matter far more than any gift.

> Healthy socializing happens when both sides feel enriched—not because of transactions, but because of presence, energy, and growth.

## 🌿 Shifting the Focus Inward

Instead of asking:
*“How do I please them so they’ll like me?”*

The question becomes: 
*“Who am I becoming? What kind of presence, ideas, and energy do I bring into the world?”*

The focus shifts **inward**—not outward.

My responsibility is not to predict how others see me, but to *cultivate* myself:

> [!info]+ Directions in which I can grow: 
> 
> - stronger self-worth
>     
> - clear boundaries
>     
> - genuine interests
>     
> - stability and direction
>     
> - a mind and voice of my own
    
When I grow in these ways, people naturally see value—not because I try harder, but because I stand firmly in who I am.

## 🌼A Healthier Model of Socializing

### 1. Self-Worth First

I am not “less”.  
I don’t have to buy approval through effort.  
I have intrinsic value simply by being who I am.

### 2. Natural Value, Not Forced Pleasing

Curiosity, sincerity, insight, thoughtfulness—  
these are higher-quality values than any gift.

### 3. Mutual Benefit, Not Transaction

A good connection is not:  
*“I give to you so you’ll like me.”*

It is:  
*“We bring something meaningful to each other.”*

> No one is “owed”.
> No one is “indebted”.
> Both sides simply feel *enriched* by the connection.

## 🌸 Closing Thought

The point isn’t to stop being kind or sincere.  
It’s to stop acting from **fear, debt, or inferiority**.

I don’t want relationships built on “I must give more so I won’t be abandoned.”  
I want relationships built on:

> I’m becoming someone with value, and people naturally want to be around that.

This shift feels empowering—  
like I’m finally placing my attention on the right person: **myself**.
