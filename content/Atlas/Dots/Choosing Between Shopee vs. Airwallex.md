## Current Choices

- Shopee: Backend Engineer, Promotion Team -- Product Backend
- Airwallex: SWE, Cloud Infra -- Infra Backend (Mid Level)

## Comparison

| **Factor**               | **Airwallex**                                                           | **Shopee**                                                            | **Concern**                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Base**                 | 10k / month                                                             | 8150 / month                                                          | That's 22k/year difference -- is it significant enough to outweigh brand? |
| **RSUs**                 | ~6k annually (vested over 4 years, need to wait for IPO / buyback)      | ~6k annually (vested over 4 years, 1 yr cliff, can be liquefied then) | /                                                                         |
| **Role**                 | Infra control plane development, Multi-cloud Migration, HA/failover     | Promotion features, business logic, APIs                              | Which better positions me for ByteDance/Google?                           |
| **Team Size**            | 4 Engineers in Shanghai + 2 in SG                                       | Larger team                                                           | Small team = more ownership vs less visibility?                           |
| **Team Diversity**       | Some Chinese members                                                    | More diverse                                                          | I value diversity - does this matter enough?                              |
| **Brand Recognition**    | Unicorn, fast-growing                                                   | Stronger brand, well-known in SEA                                     | Friends say Shopee brand makes ByteDance/Google easier - true?            |
| **Structure/Mentorship** | 6mo guided onboarding, senior mentor, weekly 1:1s, clear project scopes | Assumed structured                                                    | Both seem structured, but still Shopee may be more trustworthy?           |
| **Technical Depth**      | Deep infrastructure specialization                                      | Broader product development                                           | Infrastructure skills more valued or less?                                |

## My thought process

### My End Goal

My long-term goal is to eventually join a top-tier tech company (Google, Meta).  
So I’m evaluating both offers based on **how they position me over the next 1–2 years**.

### 1.  Proven Path vs. Less-Defined Path

There's a proven path in SG:  *Shopee → ByteDance → Google/Meta*.
So **Shopee** seems like a reliable stepping stone.

**Airwallex** is strong technically but has fewer known transitions to FAANG (probably due to a smaller, newer team?)

### 2. Technical Direction

**Shopee (Backend SWE)**
- Product backend, APIs, business logic
- Clear structure and onboarding
- Broad SWE fundamentals
- First-time exposure to product development

**Airwallex (Infra/Platform SWE2)**
- Multi-cloud infra plane, routing, failover, automation
- Deep systems experience
- Continuation of my HoYoverse infra/cloud background
- Early specialization in infra/platform engineering

### 3. Breadth vs. Depth

- Shopee gives **breadth**, letting me explore product SWE and help me understand what I truly enjoy.
- Airwallex gives **depth**, building rare infra expertise early.

I’m unsure whether early-career breadth or depth will serve me better long-term.

### 4. Resume Positioning

After a year:
- **Shopee** → broader SWE profile (product + previous infra exposure)
- **Airwallex** → specialized infra/platform profile
    
I’m unsure whether breadth (Shopee) or specialization (Airwallex) is more valuable for reaching FAANG.

### My Current Thinking

I'm leaning toward **Shopee (60%)** because:

1. **Proven path**: Many people have successfully gone Shopee → ByteDance → Google
2. **Breadth > Depth**: At my stage, exploring product backend helps me discover what I'm good at (?)
3. **1-year timeframe**: Salary difference matters less if both get me to FAANG (?)

But I'm still uncertain because:

- Airwallex pays 23% more (does this matter for 1 year?)
- Maybe depth (becoming strong in infra) is actually better positioning?
- Is the "proven path" real, or just selection bias?
