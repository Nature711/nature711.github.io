Hey Jade,

Just a quick appreciation message before CNY~ 

I just wanted to say I really enjoy our daily lunch crew — it’s honestly one of the highlights of my day. You’re always smiling and so genuinely happy, and it’s kind of contagious. Even on days when I feel stressed, just talking to you somehow makes everything feel lighter and more relaxed.

I also really appreciate how you’ve helped me along the way (yes, even when I ask very rookie questions 😂). I’ve definitely learned from you.

Really glad we get to be both colleagues and friends.

Happy Chinese New Year — 马上有钱, 马上开心, 马上 everything good 😄
