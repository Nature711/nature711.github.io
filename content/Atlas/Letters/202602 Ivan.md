## Letter

Hey Ivan,

Just a quick appreciation note before CNY!

I really appreciated how willing you were to help during my onboarding tasks. It made the whole process a lot less overwhelming.

I’ve also really enjoyed our lunch chats, especially all the sports discussions. It’s always relaxing and cheerful talking to you. Plus, always happy to talk about tennis haha! 

Feeling pretty lucky to have you as a colleague, and looking forward to working together more ahead.

Wishing you a great Chinese New Year — hope it’s full of good food, good rest, and zero bugs.

Cheers,
Tianran
