## Letter

Hi Gede,

Just wanted to say thank you.

Even before I joined, you took the time to speak with me, address my concerns, and help me understand the team better. That meant a lot and made the transition much smoother.

During onboarding, I really appreciated your constructive feedback and guidance. I especially enjoy our conversations — not just about code, but about broader perspectives on work and life. Those discussions spark my curiosity and keep me motivated.

I’m grateful to be part of this team and looking forward to contributing more.

Wishing you and your family a Happy Chinese New Year — health and happiness in the year ahead.

Best,  
Tianran
