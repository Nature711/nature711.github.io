Hi Naseer,

Before you leave, I just wanted to say a proper thank you.

Even though we’ve only worked together for a short time, I genuinely enjoyed it a lot. From the very first interview, our conversation felt natural and insightful — more like an open discussion. It made me feel excited about joining the team.

During my onboarding, I struggled a bit at the start. Your explanations were always clear, structured, and engaging, and I feel that I could easily follow your thought process. That helped me a lot, and gave me more confidence going forward and thinking independently.

I also really enjoyed our lunch chats — from engineering to life priorities, and of course our shared obsession with note management. Hopefully we’ll get to continue those discussions in the future.

As you move on to the next chapter, I wish you and your family good health, happiness, and success ahead. 

Hope our paths cross again!

Best,  
Tianran
