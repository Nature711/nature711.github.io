When I spoke with my career advisor about my [[Learning to Choose -- A Late Start|struggles with decision-making]], he said something that completely shifted my thinking:

> There’s a difference between “making the right decision” and “making the decision right.”

At first, it sounded like just a clever wordplay. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized — this single shift in mindset could solve a big part of my decision paralysis.

### What’s the difference?

**Making the right decision** means trying to find the best possible option from the start.  
The one with the highest payoff. The one that makes the most sense. The one that minimizes risk.

The problem?  
You never really know which option is “right” until way later. You’re operating with incomplete information. The variables are messy. The future is uncertain.

So this path — while rational on the surface — often leads to stress, FOMO, and endless analysis. You get stuck in loops of overthinking, always wondering if there’s a better option you’re missing.

This has been me, for years.

**Making the decision right**, on the other hand, is about committing to the choice you made — and doing everything in your power to make it work.

It’s about execution. Ownership. Adaptability.

Instead of trying to avoid all possible regret, you accept that **any** path will have pros and cons. But it’s your job to make the most of the one you chose.

This is such a freeing mindset.

It shifts your energy away from "what if" to "what now".  
It doesn’t mean being reckless — but it means recognizing that no decision will be 100% perfect in advance.  
And that’s okay. That’s life.

### How I’m applying this to my life

I used to obsess over getting decisions “right.”  
Whether to stay in Singapore or move back to China, whether to stay in tech or pivot into AI infra, whether to pursue a master’s degree or not — I’d research endlessly, ask tons of people, and still feel unsure.

But now, I’m learning to ask different questions:

- Instead of: _What’s the best decision?_  
    → I ask: _What matters most to me, right now?_
    
- Instead of: _How do I avoid making the wrong choice?_  
    → I ask: _If I choose this path, can I commit to making it meaningful?_
    
- Instead of: _What if I regret it later?_  
    → I remind myself: _Regret comes from inaction more than from imperfect action._
    

I’m starting to understand that **confidence doesn’t come from certainty — it comes from ownership**.  
You can’t control all the outcomes, but you can control your attitude and effort.

### Final thoughts

This shift isn’t easy. I still get stuck. I still want people to tell me what to do.  
But I’m learning to **trust myself a little more**, and to see decisions not as tests to ace, but as paths to _walk_.

You don’t have to make the perfect choice.  
You just have to _choose_, and then _make it yours_.

Because in the end, **the right decision is the one you make right**.
