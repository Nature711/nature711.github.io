## 🧠 1. Foundational Concepts

- [[3 Pillars of System Design]] — A core framework I use to assess tradeoffs: **availability, throughput, scalability**
- [[High-level vs. Low-level Design]] — Clarifying the two design scopes, how they differ, and when to use each

## 🗂 2. Reference Guide

- [[Back-of-Envelop Numbers Cheat Sheet]] — Quick reference for realistic metrics (QPS, latency, cache rates, DB limits) to ground design decisions

## 🧪 3. Applied Practice

- [[Design a Shopping Cart System]] — End-to-end mock design with tradeoff discussion and component breakdown
