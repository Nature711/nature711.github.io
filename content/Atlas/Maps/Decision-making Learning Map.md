## Background

### Situation

I’ve been struggling with decision-making for a long time, largely because of my perfectionistic tendencies and my desire to control every variable—even those outside my scope.  
I try to optimize everything (often with incomplete information), and when I inevitably can’t, I blame myself harshly and fall into regret.

On top of that, I’ve been obsessed with making the _“most optimal”_ choice. As a result, I often *strategically delay* decisions, believing more time will help me gather more information. Sometimes it works. But for many small, low-stakes decisions that should be made quickly, I end up *overthinking* and *over-analyzing*. That leaves me feeling constantly “*up in the air*,” which is painful for someone who craves clarity and certainty.

### Task

My career coach, Zachary, introduced me to the idea of *[[Making the Right Decision vs. Making the Decision Right]]*.

It shifts the focus from endlessly researching to ensure the _right_ choice, toward taking action to **make the chosen path work**.

I’m still learning to internalize this mindset, but remembering it helps me relax whenever I feel myself sinking into analysis paralysis again.

### Action

To train my “decision-making muscle,” Zachary and I started an ongoing assignment:  
**Every week, I record one decision — big or small— and reflect on how I made it and how I feel about the outcome.**

I’ve been doing this for four weeks now, and I’ve noticed a shift: the decisions I write about are becoming less trivial and more meaningful. It feels as if life is gradually giving me bigger challenges, but also preparing me to handle them.

### Result

Ongoing...
