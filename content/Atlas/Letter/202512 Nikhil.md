I’ve been meaning to write this for a while, and it feels like a good moment to do so.

I still look back on the uni project we worked on as one of my best collaboration experiences. We were both quite committed and curious, working through various challenges together. That kind of collaboration is honestly still what I hope for in future teams.

I’m also really glad we got to catch up over lunch long after uni. I was in the middle of job hunting and feeling pretty uncertain back then, and talking with you brought back a kind of energy I hadn’t felt in a while. It reminded me how much I value thoughtful, intellectually engaging conversations.

I’m also happy for you that you’re getting more meaningful scope at work and the opportunity to work offshore. I’m sure it’ll be a valuable experience.

Wishing you a merry Christmas and an awesome New Year ahead. It’s been really nice seeing how we’ve both grown over time. Excited for what’s ahead!
