Hey Gerald,

With Chinese New Year coming up, I just wanted to write a quick note to say thank you.

When I first joined the team, you were one of the first people who came over, offered help, and pulled me into the voucher freshie lunch group. I’m a bit introverted, so that honestly meant a lot to me and helped me settle into the team faster.

You’re definitely the one who brings the energy into the group — starting conversations, keeping things lively, and somehow making everyone feel included. It’s always nice being around that kind of vibe.

I also really appreciated all the help you gave me during the entry tasks. And it’s hard not to notice how hardworking and inquisitive you are — digging into problems and being genuinely invested in what you do... which honestly sets a pretty solid example haha.

Feeling pretty lucky to have you as a colleague, and looking forward to working together more ahead.

Wishing you a great Chinese New Year — hope it’s full of good food, good rest, and zero bugs.

Cheers,
Tianran
