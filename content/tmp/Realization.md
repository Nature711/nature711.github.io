- Once a decision is finalized, don't overthink / second-guess about it. Instead, channel your energy to "make that decision right" -- by optimizing the path forward

- Because your energy is limited, if you spent too much time reflecting on the past decision / wondering about the "what-ifs" / alternative etc., (the past), you miss the opportunity (i.e., the time you have right now) to shape your path forward (future)

- We may not always have perfect information at the time when the decision was made, but we have the ability to prove it right by sticking along the way and do the best we can to optimize the future
