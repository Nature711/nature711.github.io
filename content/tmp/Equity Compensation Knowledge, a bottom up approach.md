The Core idea: 

Companies want you to think like an owner, not just an employee.
If you own part of the company, you'll work harder to make it succeed because _you_ benefit when the stock price goes up. -- tying your interest with theirs

## Concepts

### Public vs. private companies

- public: stocks traded on stock exchange
- private: no public market; shares locked until IPO / buyback

### RSU vs. options

RSU: free shares *vested* after certain period
- received at no cost, can sell after vesting
- tax at vesting -- risk of tax surprise (paid tax, but yet to sell, and stock dropped)
- more common in later-stage / public companies that are more stable

stock options: allowing employee to buy shares at a discounted / fixed price
- you still have to pay to buy it, just at a discounted price
- can benefit later if stock rises
- more common in early stage startups with high growth potential
- related: cashless exercise (buy stock at the option price and and sell immediately, without incurring any cash, all handled by broker) -- less risk less return

risk: stock option > RSU
- stock option: require upfront investment; risk of stock not climbing after expiry date
- rsu: no upfront cost, guaranteed value

reward: option > RSU
- option: leverage -- small % change in stock price leads to higher % return on initial investment

> company usually gives out more stock options than RSU to compensate for (options') higher risk

### Vesting

vesting: the process of gaining full ownership rights to an asset
