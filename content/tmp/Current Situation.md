Shopee Offer (received, written format)
- Base is good (but still a bit less than my expectation)
- I *negotiated once* (before the written offer is sent); after nego, they pushed the base slightly higher and added some RSU (though very little; probably just a psychological sweetener?)
- They expect me to reply by **Friday 6pm (tmr)**

What I still have: 
- A few ongoing pipelines:
	- Manus AI: final round done, waiting for result (promised today)
	- Airwallex: final round next week (potentially higher salary)
- Probably those 2 roles will offer me higher (?)
- But considering the nature of the role, the Shopee one is still a **better fit for my long-term backend/system direction**

Dilemma:
 - I **want to accept** Shopee, but still nudge salary **slightly higher** (+200), but have no leverage (currently?)
 - I worried that nego further may **risk losing the offer** -- I believe this role is quite competitive, and they may just go with another candidate who accepted faster...)


Main Confusions:

How to safely ask Shopee for more time beyond Friday?

When/how to negotiate Shopee’s salary without risking the offer?

How to handle competing offers professionally?

How to balance long-term fit vs. short-term compensation vs. timing pressure?
