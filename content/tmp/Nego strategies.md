Hi  (i - lie - juh), thanks for taking the call — I really appreciate it.”

I’ve been thinking a lot about this role. And I think it aligns very well with where I want to grow long-term, so I'm quite excited about it.  

I'm still trying to make the decision carefully because of 
1. the timing around bonuses and annual leave compensation from my current company.
2. And also just to be transparent, I’m still in the final stages with a few other opportunities. 

So I wanna check, if there’s any flexibility that we could bring the base to around x 
If that’s possible, I’d be happy to confirm quickly.

### Likely A 

> Ok let me get back to you soon

Sure, thank you so much — I appreciate you checking.  
Let me know what’s possible, I’m happy to move quickly.

### Likely B

> We already added RSUs, which is rare for juniors

“Yes, and I really appreciate that — it meant a lot to me.  
And for the base, even a small adjustment helps me align the transition, especially with the timing factors I mentioned.  
If we can reach that range, I’d be very happy to confirm right away.”

### Likely C

> May I ask what other processes you’re in?

Just a couple of roles in cloud and backend — all still ongoing.  
But S is still my top preference, and is also where I feel the strongest alignment overall,
so if we can close the small gap, I’d be very happy to confirm quickly.

### Likely D

> “The budget is tight, and increasing base salary is difficult.”

“I understand — and I really appreciate you checking.  
If there’s even a small room for adjustment, it would help me confirm confidently.  

If No: 
Give me a day to think through everything and I’ll get back to you.”

> “Do you plan to join us only if we increase the salary?”

“I’m very interested in joining — I wouldn’t be having this conversation otherwise.  
The adjustment would just help me make the decision with confidence.”

### Follow-up on RSU

By the way, I had a small question — is the RSU grant price based on the grant date or the vesting date? Just want to understand how it works.
