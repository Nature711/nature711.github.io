## Digital Garden, Next Iteration

### Feature

- [ ] Set up web traffic monitoring & real-time analytics (heavy task, can do iteratively)
- [ ] Find ways to allow user interaction (e.g., like posts, comments, etc.)

### Content (seeds to grow)

- [ ] Convert this to-do page into a "What to Expect Next" section in index page, for better reader experience
- [ ] Continuation of [[Personal Knowledge Management, the Database Way]] -- the idea that whenever I add a new note, I don't just put it randomly -- I need to update the index / maps in order for better future retrieval -- similar to the idea of updating index when upserting db -- which may introduce silent overhead during update, but ease retrieval later
	- can even refer to the struggle at most companies -- scattered docs, almost impossible to find / read, lower productivity, higher communication overhead, etc.
	- but when the overhead is too large, it may hinder the note creation :(  need to find a balance
- [x] Explaining the philosophy behind organizing notes in such way -- how folder structure is clear but you're not supposed to dig notes from their; instead look at the Maps -- yes, maps
- [ ] Explaining why I love this digital garden -- quote from nick milo, when i have an idea, i want to be able to hold on to it, to internalize it, and to be reminded of it later, etc. 


> hopefully to finish by the end of November, but I have more urgent & important stuff to deal with which may cause some delay xD
