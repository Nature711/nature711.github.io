what i hate the most: stuck in the limbo
- this weird **limbo month**: waiting for contract → resign → notice period → transition → new start
- i hate this kind of period the most, cuz i did poorly in the past -- like essentially just waiting, but BUSY waiting -- spinning all the time but in a meaningless way, so just wasting energy. which is even worse than just sleep or go party whatsover, at least the latter can give me happiness / rest; but what i did was just researching and studying random stuff which turned out to be nothing and completely wasted; don't tell me anything about connecting the dots / nothing is wasted, IT IS just wasted, objectively, no doubt! 
- the last time was probably after graduation and before i start working (~2 month), went on a family trip, met some old friends, the rest of the time just busy researching useless stuff. trying to write a few reflections but 虎头蛇尾 again, so meaningless and wasted; tried to study some infra stuff but learned nothing, so i guess just completely wasted 

i hate fake productivity, I want experiences & efforts that
- curated, meaningful, high-leverage
- compound over time

reflect on
- 3 things I did right in my job search
- 3 things I would do differently
- 3 mindsets I want to practise going forward (e.g., clarity > speed)

structured progress makes me feel more powerful & energized (even more powerful than taking a nap)
