Reflection on time -- I may think 2yrs are very long, but looking back... It's around 2 yrs since i received hoyo offer

Reflection on decision at that time & journey
- 2 of my internship experiences touched devops -- giving me extra advantages (which others may not have exposure to)
- so it's natural to continue in that direction -- like systems design / infra, k8s, kind of thing
- but reality? not as expected
- so i change 
- where the motivation came from? -- i always feel not ready to get started
- but turns out you're never ready until you decide to -- readiness it's a choice not a state
- the biggest trigger is my besties' leaving and going to google -- i was shocked and finally awakened 
- then i start -- with her support & so many other friends as well -- along the way
- this 1 month is the busiest, yet most fulfilling month i've had, for a long time
- preparing & improving along the way (every new interview i see an updated version of myself)
- even feel addicted to interview lol -- cuz i missed some points and i wanna redo
- the fun thing is, you can interview with zero cost! all the lessons can be learned entirely for free! and if u get rejected by 1 company u still have dozens of chances!

consolidate my understanding of RSU & Stock
 - can also reflect on my learning process
	 - linear, structured? (like waterfall, clear, but following other's structure, may feel irrelevant  / less motivated)
	 - use a case study as anchor, then expand from it (may be a bit messy at the start; discovering structure & gain clarity along the way)
	 - balance: use less structured format to learn, but output / present your result in a clear & structured format

learn a bit of psychology in practice -- cooperative & collaboration mindset; lying our interest together to see if we can work out with a solution that maximizes for both of us
- understanding other's fear / concern
