- reflect on shopee interview; build correct mindset for large-scale, high QPS voucher system
- abnormal AI project -- understand requirement, repo


- reflecting on the idea of "collaboration chemistry" 
	- related: the collaboration mindset I should use during interview -- instead of being too serious and treating the interviewer as some monster, I can just treat him / her as a teammate with whom i can collaborate
- reflection: i tend to focus on too much nighty righty detail -- because i had too little exposure to more meaningful stuff
