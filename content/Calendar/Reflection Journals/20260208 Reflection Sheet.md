## 1. Stop — What do I need to stop doing?

> Stop decision remorse.

Stop using my present self to judge and blame my past self — especially when my past self did not have the same information, maturity, or perspective I have now.
### Current Pattern

As I gain new information, I often:
- Romanticize paths not taken (i.e., the "parallel universe")
- Drained myself in regret & emotional self-criticism
    
> Reflection is healthy, but emotional rumination is not.

> [!important] Shift
> Channel energy toward building the future instead of replaying the past.

## 2. Priorities — 3 non-negotiables

### 1. Career Growth

- Strengthen backend fundamentals
- Grow faster and more intentionally
- Regaining momentum & confidence
- Understand whether this direction truly fits me

### 2. Meaningful Social Connection

- High-quality relationships
- Intentional connection
- Presence with good people

### 3. Financial Management

#### Current Problem

> Focused too much on *saving* (节流）and not enough on *creating*（开源）

- Over-optimize small expenses
- Compare prices excessively
- Drain mental energy on minor savings

#### Mindset shift: From scarcity to abundance

- Invest intentionally
- Learn structured financial knowledge
- Build long-term earning capacity

---
## 3. Energy — Where am I wasting it?

### Regret loops (#1 in Stop)

- Constantly replaying old decisions
- Emotionally attaching to alternative realities

### Hyper-optimization of trivial things (#3 in Priorities)

- Research excessively about where to go for the next holiday, try to find the "best" place by taking into numerous factors
- Spending excessive time trying to find the cheapest / best option when buying small things

> Consequence: Not enough energy when it comes it decisions that really matters.

---
## 4. Avoidance — What am I avoiding because it’s uncomfortable?

> Financial planning

Reason: 
- Requires structured learning
- Feels complex
- Demands long-term thinking

Meanwhile, I envy friends who: 
- planned early
- took steps towards their goals
- built assets successfully

> Takeaway: Delay The best time to start is NOW.

## 5. Desire — What do I want more of this year?

**Clarity.**

Clarity in:

- Career direction
    
- Strengths and weaknesses
    
- Relationship compatibility
    
- Self-understanding
    

I know clarity is not a one-time realization.  
It is built through action and feedback.

But I want to feel:

- On track
    
- Intentional
    
- Less internally fragmented

## 6. Success — What does success mean in 2026?

Two dimensions:

### Career Success

- Perform strongly in current role
    
- Increase compensation OR
    
- Transition to a better opportunity (if aligned)
    

Not just salary — but growth + meaningful challenge.

---

### Emotional Success

- Become internally coherent (逻辑自洽)
    
- Stop bouncing between decisions
    
- Develop stable self-confidence
    
- Make clean decisions without constant doubt
    

---

## 7. Trust — What would I do if I trusted myself more?

In the past:

- I rushed decisions out of fear.
    
- I underestimated my market value.
    
- I settled quickly instead of negotiating confidently.
    

If I trusted myself more:

- I would negotiate harder.
    
- I would wait for better terms.
    
- I would assess my value more accurately.
    
- I would make decisions from strength, not urgency.
    

This is not about regret —  
it’s about recalibrating self-worth going forward.

---

## 8. Alignment — What needs to change to feel aligned?

Two major internal conflicts:

### Career Alignment

- I feel challenged and struggle daily in backend.
    
- I question if I’m truly good at it.
    
- I wonder if I should pivot to something more communication-oriented (e.g., PM).
    

Conflict:  
Growth pain vs wrong direction?

---

### Relationship Alignment

- Stability vs passion.
    
- Suitability vs emotional spark.
    
- Being committed while feeling drawn elsewhere.
    

This creates cognitive dissonance and emotional confusion.

Alignment requires honest evaluation — not avoidance.

---

## 9. Let Go — What am I ready to release?

I want to let go of:

- Regret over bonuses and benefits I gave up.
    
- Comparison with “what could have been.”
    
- Anger toward my past impulsiveness.
    
- Fantasy narratives about other companies.
    

These are sunk costs.

Holding them drains future capacity.

---

## 10. Identity — Who do I choose to be in 2026?

I want to become:

- Self-generated, not externally ignited.
    
- Someone who brings joy to herself first.
    
- Someone who radiates energy instead of chasing it.
    
- Internally stable — not reactive to every external stimulus.
    

Less dependency on external validation.  
More internal authorship.

Not driven by “something outside lighting me up.”

But becoming the light source.

# Meta Observation

Across all 10 themes, one pattern repeats:

**Energy ownership.**

- Stop leaking it.
    
- Stop outsourcing it.
    
- Stop attaching it to the past.
    
- Stop attaching it to external sparks.
    

Your real theme of 2026 might not be “clarity.”

It might be:

> **Reclaiming authorship over your energy and decisions.**

If you'd like, next we can:

- Distill this into a 1-page manifesto
    
- Extract 3 guiding words for 2026
    
- Or turn this into a clean “monthly review template” you can reuse
    

You are not messy.

You are just in transition.
