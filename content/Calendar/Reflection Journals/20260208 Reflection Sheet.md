And here I'm going to write my first uh reflection. Uh, so there are 10 themes here and I'm going to reflect one by one. So first, stop. What do I need to stop doing this year? It reviews the energy drains and misalignment and give me less friction so that I can aim towards more clarity. And I think an important thing I wanna stop doing this year is to stop decision remorse and like use the present self to blame the past self when the past me doesn't have enough information or wasn't mature enough. Yeah, so every time as I gain new information, I tend to realize some of my previous choices are incorrect and I'm always in that parallel universe version and idealize the past that I haven't taken the choices I haven't made and wonder about all the what-ifs. And sometimes it is good, generally good, to reflect on the decision and to extract meaning out of it. Yeah, that's the good part, but what I did was I tend to be quite emotional and just get sunk in the emotion of loss and feel so bad about myself. And yeah, and that made me feel too bad, too bad, and I wasted a lot of energy and that drained me and yeah, kept me in a like a remorse state. So I know it's a hard thing to change, but I try to stop and channel my energy to more meaningful things because choices are choices, what's the past is past.And second is the priority, what matters most in this year, three non-negotiables. I think the first one is my career growth. I want to close the gap sooner because I feel that I've wasted so much time in the previous company not learning anything and falling behind my peers. So I want to wrap up and grow in backend direction and learn the fundamentals and grow fast, as fast as possible. Yeah, that's the career. And also better understand myself whether it's a good fit. Yeah, also, yeah. And the second priority is the social connection. So I need to, because at this time, it's not just about developing on your own or 闭门造车吧. It's more about building meaningful connection, which will help you and good relationship also nurture you. Yeah. And yeah, so I want to maintain good connection with good people. Yeah, and I need to actively allocate the time for that and be present. Third, the priority is for financial management. Yeah, I need to start investing and finding more meaningful ways of allocating my money and explore my relationship with money because I tend to, because there is the term 开源节流, I tend to do 节流 too much but not thinking about the 开源. Yeah, that's a bad mindset. Yeah, because I'm always trying to save, but I've, that drained too much of my energy and I really want to be more proactive and change my mindset and find more meaningful ways to earn more money instead of just focusing on saving. Yeah, and I explore more ways of doing so. Yeah.OK, third one is energy. Where am I wasting energy? Uh, yeah, a lot of things. So one is um what I mentioned is tightly coupled to the first one, the action I want to stop, uh, which is like decision remorse. I'm trying to 陷入一些负面情绪 and uh regret about the decision I made and the path idealizing the path not taken and feel so bad about that. Yeah, um I want to channel more energy into building the future instead of remorseing the past. Uh and the second one is about um yeah, it's tied to the second priority, uh the the money thing. I'm wasting too much energy trying to find the cheapest thing, trying to uh save money and compare a lot of things financially, whereas I could have used that energy to uh build more meaningful things.
