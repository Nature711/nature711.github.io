## 1. Stop — What do I need to stop doing?

> **Stop decision remorse.**

Stop using my present self to judge and blame my past self — especially when my past self did not have the same information, maturity, or perspective I have now.
### Current Pattern

As I gain new information, I often:
- *Romanticize* paths not taken (i.e., the "parallel universe")
- *Drained* myself in regret & emotional self-criticism
    
> Reflection is healthy, but emotional rumination is not.

> [!important] Shift
> Channel energy toward building the future instead of replaying the past.

## 2. Priorities — 3 non-negotiables

### 1. Career Growth

- Strengthen backend fundamentals
- Grow faster and more intentionally
- Regaining momentum & confidence
- Understand whether this direction truly fits me

### 2. Meaningful Social Connection

- High-quality relationships
- Intentional connection
- Presence with good people

### 3. Financial Management

#### Current Problem

> Focused too much on *saving* (节流）and not enough on *creating*（开源）

- Over-optimize small expenses
- Compare prices excessively
- Drain mental energy on minor savings

#### Mindset shift: From scarcity to abundance

- Invest intentionally
- Learn structured financial knowledge
- Build long-term earning capacity

## 3. Energy — Where am I wasting it?

### 1. Regret loops (#1 in Stop)

- Constantly replaying old decisions
- Emotionally attaching to alternative realities

### 2. Hyper-optimization of trivial things (#3 in Priorities)

- Research excessively about where to go for the next holiday, try to find the "best" place by taking into numerous factors
- Spending excessive time trying to find the cheapest / best option when buying small things

> Consequence: Not enough energy when it comes it decisions that really matters.

---
## 4. Avoidance — What am I avoiding because it’s uncomfortable?

> **Financial planning.**

Reason: 
- Requires structured learning
- Feels complex
- Demands long-term thinking

Meanwhile, I envy friends who: 
- planned early
- took steps towards their goals
- built assets successfully

> Takeaway: Delay The best time to start is NOW. 

---
## 5. Desire — What do I want more of this year?

> **Clarity.**

Clarity in:
- Career direction
- Personal strengths & weaknesses
- Relationship compatibility

I know: 
- Clarity is not a one-time realization
- It's built through action and feedback

But I want to feel:
- On track
- Intentional
- Less internally fragmented（内在撕裂感）

---
## 6. Success — What does success mean in 2026?

### 1. Career Success

- Perform strongly in current role
- Increase compensation OR
- Transition to a better opportunity (if aligned)
    
> Not just salary — but growth + meaningful challenge.

### 2. Emotional Success

- Become internally coherent (逻辑自洽)
- Stop bouncing between decisions
- Develop stable self-confidence
    
---
## 7. Trust — What would I do if I trusted myself more?

> [Past] Negotiate better. 

Last time when I changed job and chose offers, I:
- rushed decisions out of fear
- settled quickly instead of negotiating confidently
- gave up bonus & other benefits

If I trusted myself more, I would: 
- negotiate harder
- wait for better terms
- make decisions from strength, not urgency

---
## 8. Alignment — What needs to change to feel aligned?

### 1. Career Alignment

- Feel challenged and struggle daily in backend.
- Question if I’m truly good at it
- Wonder if I should pivot to something "less technical" (e.g. PM, Solution Architect)

> Conflict: Growth pain vs wrong direction? 

### 2. Relationship Alignment

- Stability vs passion
- Suitability vs emotional spark
- Being committed while feeling drawn elsewhere

> Alignment requires honest evaluation — not avoidance.

---
## 9. Let Go — What am I ready to release?

> Negative thinkings about my job hop:

- Regret over bonuses and benefits I gave up
- Comparison with “what could have been”
- Anger toward my past impulsiveness
- Fantasy narratives about other companies

> These are sunk costs.
> Holding them drains future capacity.

---
## 10. Identity — Who do I choose to be in 2026?

- Someone who **radiates energy** instead of chasing it
	- Not driven by “something outside lighting me up”
	- Becoming the light source *myself*

- **Internally stable** — not reactive to every external stimulus
	- Less dependency on external validation
	- More internal authorship

---
## Meta Observation

> Cross-cutting pattern: **Energy ownership**

- Stop leaking it.
- Stop outsourcing it.
- Stop attaching it to the past.
- Stop attaching it to external sparks.

> **Reclaiming authorship over my energy and decisions.**
