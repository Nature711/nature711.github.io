“Airwallex is building the global financial platform — everything from multi-currency business accounts, global transfers, to embedded finance.

Under the hood, this requires global distributed systems, multi-region consistency, low-latency payment routing, high availability for money-moving services, and strong automation for hundreds of engineers.

What excites me is that the infra team is the backbone of all this. and that the infrastructure work here has direct business impact. When I optimize a Kubernetes cluster or build a better deployment system, I'm not just saving compute costs - I'm enabling a small business in Brazil to sell to customers in Japan without thinking about payment complexity. That connection between infrastructure and real-world commerce is compelling."

This directly overlaps with my experience in global monitoring, cross-region infra, observability systems, and distributed infrastructure tooling. I want to grow into building the underlying platforms that make products like Airwallex possible.”

“Airwallex operates globally distributed systems.  
In my previous role, I built cross-region observability and multi-region monitoring systems, so I understand how critical it is to detect routing issues early and maintain reliability across cloud regions.”

Think about great answers to questions like:

- Why Airwallex? What excites you about fintech and our problem space?
- What actually are we building, what are we solving for, what do you know about our Product range and use cases?
- What are the most impactful things you’ve built/improved in your career?

"What really clicks for me is how Airwallex enables global businesses that I actually care about. Take gaming companies like HoYoverse with Genshin Impact - they have players in 150+ countries all buying in-game currency in their local currencies. Behind that seamless player experience is incredibly complex infrastructure: multi-currency payment processing, cross-border supplier payments, managing revenue across regions with different regulations.

That's where Airwallex's infrastructure comes in - the Kubernetes platforms I'd be building are what makes it possible for a player in Brazil to buy primogems in BRL while a developer in Montreal gets paid in CAD, all processed reliably at scale. It's infrastructure work with direct connection to products millions of people use daily."
