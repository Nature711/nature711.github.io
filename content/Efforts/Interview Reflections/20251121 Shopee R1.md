## Opening

[[HoYoverse Project Summary#Opening]]

I'm Tianran, currently working at HoYoverse as a Software Engineer, focusing on infrastructure and cloud systems.

A lot of my work is about making our global infrastructure more reliable and observable.

Some examples including:

- a cross-region network diagnostics service that gave our teams latency visibility;
- a cloud resource utilization reporting pipeline that improved capacity planning;
- Kafka replication automation workflow to make cross-cluster rollbacks safer

Before this, I studied CS at NUS, where I built projects like a Paxos-based distributed KV Store, and an order-matching engine using concurrency patterns in Go — that’s where my interest in distributed systems started.

Now I’m looking for a backend role where I can apply that systems foundation to product features with real user impact.

## Questions to ask

“I actually had a fun experience during 11.11 — I claimed a big voucher successfully, but a few seconds later it showed as fully redeemed when I tried to use it. I imagine this is a tough problem during peak traffic.
I’m curious from a backend perspective: how does the team handle consistency issues in high-traffic events like this? And what are some of the challenges the team is currently focusing on improving?”

“Given promotions are high-traffic and high-stakes, what does the on-call experience look like? How does the team prevent or manage campaign-day incidents?”
