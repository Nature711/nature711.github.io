## Meta

- Company: Shopee
- Role: Backend Engineer
- Team: Marketplace, Promotion Team
- Interviewer: Gede Pentium
- Focus: Experience deep dive

---
## Overview

Focus: **experience deep-dives**, **technical articulation**, **reflection on ownership** 

- Insight project → purpose, design, challenges, business value
- Resource Utilization system → architecture, impact, improvements
- Understanding of Takumi, and reasoning for framework choices
- Views on AI and how it changes the engineering workflow
- Ability to reflect (“What would you do differently?”)

Overall evaluation
- Communicated the **high-level** ideas clearly
- But struggled when the interviewer pushed for **concrete examples, grounded business impact, and deeper reasoning** behind technical decisions

## What I Did Well

### Clear STAR storytelling

Explained both Insight and the Resource Utilization project, I was able to articulate:

- **Situation**
    
- **Task**
    
- **Action**
    
- **Result**
    

My explanations were structured and understandable.

## **2.2 Strong articulation of AI-assisted workflow**

When discussing Cursor + ChatGPT + Claude:

- I highlighted how I use AI as an accelerant, not a crutch.
    
- I explained the senior–junior analogy (I design, AI executes).
    
- I demonstrated thoughtful, modern engineering workflows.
    

This made a good impression because it showed maturity and self-awareness.

## **2.3 Honest reflection**

I didn’t pretend to know everything and acknowledged the limits of my experience, especially around:

- Takumi’s internal complexity
    
- Project usage and adoption
    
- How I would redesign the system
    

This honesty was good — but I need more preparation behind it.

# 3. **Where I Struggled**

## **3.1 Weak articulation of concrete technical problems with Takumi**

When he asked:

> “What’s _one real_ problem you faced with the Takumi framework?”

I only managed to say “it’s complex” and “I used Cursor to understand it”.

Missing:

- specific bug
    
- unexpected behavior
    
- something I debugged
    
- a precise limitation I hit
    

This made the story feel shallow.

## **3.2 Insufficient reasoning for “Why use Takumi?”**

I said:

- “We’re told to use it”
    
- “Convenient bundling of Prometheus, Consul, Zest”
    

But I missed the real reasoning:

- **Standardization across entire tech org**
    
- **Consistent observability, config, RPC semantics**
    
- **Reducing fragmentation and onboarding cost**
    
- **Internal gateway/gRPC ecosystem compatibility**
    

This is a must-prepare topic.

## **3.3 Could not give grounded examples for business value**

For insight:  
I could explain hypothetical benefits but lacked actual cases.

For resource utilization:  
I had **no real cost numbers**, **no adoption metrics**, and no concrete team impact.

The interviewer asked several times:

- “How much cost saved?”
    
- “Any success stories?”
    
- “How do you know teams use it?”
    

I didn’t have answers.

This is not fully my fault (the system wasn’t actually used), but I still need **plausible, grounded narratives** in future interviews.

## **3.4 Missed opportunities in the “redo the project” question**

I wasn’t ready for:

> “If you were to do it again, what would you do differently?”

I gave a vague answer about writing my own tools, which didn’t sound senior or intentional.

For Insight:

- I should have talked about probe scheduling, configuration, plug-ins, noise reduction, baselines.
    

For Utilization:

- I should have talked about trend forecasting, cost dashboards, multi-cloud abstractions.

# 4. **What I Learned About Myself**

### **4.1 I understand the systems technically, but not their organizational context**

This interview exposed a gap:

- I can design the system
    
- I can explain the architecture
    
- But I struggle to articulate **why it matters to the business**
    
- And I lack **usage metrics** / **impact stories**
    

### **4.2 I need to prepare “deep slices” — not just high-level**

Interviewers don’t want:

- “Takumi is complex”
    
- “It bundles best practices”
    
- “The system helps debugging”
    

They want:

- a specific bug I chased for 2 hours
    
- a confusing internal Takumi behavior and how I investigated
    
- a concrete incident where Insight cut diagnosis time
    
- a false alarm scenario and how I improved it
    

These “deep slices” make me look senior.

### **4.3 I need to own the story even if the project impact is low**

Resource Utilization was not widely used — that’s okay.  
But I still need to frame:

- what problem it _intended_ to solve
    
- how I designed it to be extensible
    
- what I’d do differently now
    
- what I learned about stakeholder alignment
    

Not knowing the impact is less bad than not having a reflection.

# 5. **Action Items (for future interviews)**

### **5.1 Prepare 3 concrete challenges with Takumi**

Examples:

- gRPC metadata propagation issues
    
- Gateway routing quirks
    
- Unexpected shutdown behavior (terminator)
    
- Zest config hot reload edge cases
    
- Tracing context not propagating
    

### **5.2 Prepare 2 real “business-impact” narratives for Insight**

Even hypothetical-but-realistic ones:

- Caught abnormal latency in SG ↔ JP route
    
- Helped isolate a forwarding bottleneck
    
- Prevented a debugging spiral by identifying wrong hop
    

### **5.3 Prepare safe, realistic cost examples for Resource Utilization**

Not exaggerated, but credible:

- “In typical BU X, an idle t3.large costs $XX/month; identifying 20 such nodes saves ~$Xk/month.”
    
- “In environments with hundreds of EC2s, even small optimizations compound.”
    

### **5.4 Prepare a polished “redo the project” answer**

For both Insight & Utilization:

- modularity
    
- configuration
    
- reliability
    
- scaling
    
- stakeholder feedback loop
    

### **5.5 Practice listening during Q&A**

I noticed I _zoned out_ when asking questions, likely from stress.  
To address:

- Pause before asking
    
- Write down key points
    
- Slow your breathing
    
- Remember: Q&A isn’t evaluated — it’s for you

# 6. **Final Reflection**

Despite the gaps, this interview was extremely valuable. It highlighted:

- Exactly which parts of my stories are solid
    
- Where depth is missing
    
- Where concrete examples are needed
    
- What “senior-level reasoning” looks like in Shopee backend/system design interviews

## Questions

Given my background in infra + backend, which parts of the promotion system do you think I can contribute to most immediately?
