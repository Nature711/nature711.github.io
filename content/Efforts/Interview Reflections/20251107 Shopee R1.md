## Review 

### Part 1: Project Walkthrough

- Interviewer asked me to choose 1 project to talk about (instead of him asking a specific one)
- I chose the [[Observability & Monitoring|observability / Kafka MM2 monitoring]] project (since it was easier to explain)
- My explanation of the system flow was clear, but my **personal contribution sounded too small** (mainly integrating MM2 into metrics + exporter).
- Regretted not choosing the [[Insight -- Interview Talking Points|Insight / Takumi gRPC service project]] — more backend-relevant.
- When asked about **challenges**, I didn’t have a strong prepared answer; only mentioned using `strace` to debug.
    
> [!warning] Takeaway
> - Choose a project where I have _strong ownership and engineering narrative_.
> - Prepare challenge–solution stories for every project.

### Part 2: Coding Section

#### Problem 1: Two Sum

- Solved basic Two-Sum with HashMap smoothly.
- Follow-up required returning **all valid pairs**; I adapted solution but needed to reason carefully about duplicates.
- Asked to design **my own test cases**; tested with negative numbers, duplicates, corner cases, etc.
    
#### Problem 2: LRU Cache

- Was not well-prepared for **class-based** coding questions in Python.
- Proposed approach (single queue) didn’t meet O(1) requirement; corrected to HashMap + Doubly Linked List.
- Coded the entire class before testing → resulted in many *errors and panic*.

> [!warning] Takewaway
> 
> - Build iteratively: define Node → test; LinkedList ops → test; cache methods → test.
> - Add print debugging for visibility.
> - Practice writing classes in Python + LRU pattern.

- Follow-ups: Concurrency issue
	- Interviewer asked whether my LRU is safe under **concurrent access**
	- I answered “no” and mentioned using locks but couldn’t talk about real experience.

### Part 3: Networking Fundamentals

- Standard question: “What happens when you enter a URL?”
- Explained DNS → TCP handshake → send HTTP request → server processing → browser rendering.
- Interviewer asked deeper: difference between HTTP vs HTTPS, how TLS ensures security.
- Explained: HTTPS is secure, supported by TLS with cert verification + key exchange → encrypted channel.

## Questions to Interviewer

### About the Team

Team owns the **core buyer experience flow** in the Shopee app, covering: 

- Buyer login and identity
- Cart, checkout, payment
- Order fulfillment
- Notifications during the order life cycle

→ extremely user-facing, core team

### Biggest technical challenges

1. **Handling traffic peaks**
	- Especially during big campaigns
	- Massive traffic comes in during a short time window — requires load prediction, concurrency tuning, and stress resilience
        
2. **Long and complex business flow**
	- The buyer’s lifecycle is long: login → browse → pay → fulfill → rate
	- Many edge cases, compliance checks, and seller-side requests make the logic hard to scale and maintain.
        
3. **Platformization & Developer Experience**
	- Actively building **internal infra tooling** (like DI-based platforms) to improve developer productivity, maintainability, and onboarding

## Areas to improve

### 1. Project Storytelling & Ownership

- Pick the right project
- Show end-to-end ownership
- Prepare: problem → architecture → your role → challenges → impact (STAR Story Format)
- Be ready with 2–3 “deep dive” details

> **Goal**: sound like an engineer who built a real service, not someone who stitched components.

### 2. Coding Fluency for Backend Roles

- Clean class implementation (LRU, cache, rate limiter)
- Step-by-step build and iterative testing
- Ability to come up with meaningful testcases
- Ability to extend your solution under follow-up questions (e.g., concurrency)
