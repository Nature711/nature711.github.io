> [!info] Some meaningful info shared by my friend, when we were on our way back after a tennis session. 

## Why Invest? The Cost of Waiting

### 1. Inflation is Eating Your Money

- Average inflation: 2-3% annually
- Bank savings: ~0.5-1% interest
- **Net result**: losing 1-2% in purchasing power every year
- $10,000 today → worth only $7,400 in 10 years (real terms)

### 2. The Compounding Gap

**Same $10,000 over 30 years**:

- Savings account (1%): $13,478
- Investment (8%): $100,627
- **Opportunity cost**: $87,149 lost by "staying safe"

### 3. Make Money Work for You

- **Working**: Trade time for money (linear)
- **Investing**: Money makes money while you sleep (exponential)
- **Goal**: Investment returns eventually exceed salary → financial independence

## Fundamental Investment Principles

### Risk-Return Relationship

> [!important] Universal Law: Risk-Return Trade-off
> - High risk = higher potential return
> - Low risk = modest but stable return

- **Individual Differences**
	- Everyone has different risk tolerance based on their situation and psycholog
	- No "one size fits all" approach

### The Underlying Logic of Investing

> [!important] Core Belief in Long-term Growth
> Most investment strategies rest on the fundamental assumption that certain systems will **improve over time**.

#### 3 Levels of Belief (ascending risk / return):

|            | Global Index Funds                                     | Country-Specific Indices (e.g., US)        | Individual Stocks                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Belief     | world economy will grow                                | specific nation will thrive                | specific company will outperform                           |
| Logic      | human progress, innovation, global economic expansion  | betting on one country's economic success  | betting on a company's comparative advantage, growth, etc. |
| Investment | global indices (e.g., MSCI World, FTSE Global All Cap) | national indices (e.g., S&P 500, FTSE 100) | single company's share (e.g., Apple, Tesla)                |
| Risk       | lowest                                                 | moderate                                   | high                                                       |

## Portfolio Construction Strategies

### Diversification & Hedging

**Example Portfolio**:

- **S&P 500**: Exposure to large-cap US companies (broad American economic growth)
- **QQQ (Nasdaq-100)**: Tech-heavy, innovation-focused companies
- **VEA/VWO/VXUS**: International exposure beyond the US (Europe, Asia, emerging markets)

**The Hedging Concept**:

- **Purpose**: Don't put all eggs in one basket—reduce concentration risk
- **Mechanism**: When one market underperforms, others may compensate
- **Example**: If US market struggles, international markets might hold steady or grow
- **Balance**: No single event (political crisis, recession in one region) destroys your entire portfolio

### Simplified Approaches

- Some prefer single-market focus (just S&P 500 or total world index)
- "Set and forget" strategy—historically delivers 7-10% annually
- Less stress, lower fees, often outperforms active management

## Time Horizons: Short-term vs. Long-term

### Short-term Trading

- **High volatility**, requires constant monitoring
- **Strategy example**:
    - Buy the dip: Purchase when a stock drops significantly
    - Sell the bounce: Exit when it recovers to previous levels or higher
    - Profit from the spread: The difference is your gain
- **Higher risk/reward**, emotionally demanding

### Long-term Investing

- **Low maintenance** (check quarterly/annually)
- Relies on **compound growth**: Time in the market beats timing the market
- The "sleep method": Buy and hold for 20-30 years without emotional interference

>[!info]+ The Rule of 72
> - **Formula**: 72 ÷ Annual Return (%) = Years to Double Your Money
> - e.g., 12% return → 72 ÷ 12 = 6 years to double
> - **Compound interest magic**: After 30 years at 10% annual return, your investment grows roughly 17x

## Investment Psychology

### Why Investing is Counter-intuitive

- Human instinct: prioritize immediate, tangible gains, loss aversion
- Investing requires: delayed gratification, tolerating uncertainty, patience

### Market Volatility Test

**COVID-19 example (2020)**:

- Markets crashed 30-40% in March
- Panic-sellers locked in losses
- Markets recovered within months, reached new highs
- **Lesson**: Markets are resilient; temporary crises pass

### Emotional Discipline

**Common traps**: Panic selling, FOMO buying, checking too often, recency bias

**Solutions**:
- Automate monthly contributions
- Pre-commit to strategy, follow mechanically
- Check portfolio quarterly maximum
- Study historical crashes and recoveries

> This mindset applies beyond investing: career building, relationships, health, learning — **prioritizing long-term value over short-term comfort**.

## Practical Implementation

### Platform Selection (SG context)

- **Moomoo**: User-friendly, lower fees, good for beginners 
- **IBKR**: Professional-grade, global access, competitive fees, more complex

**Comparison factors**:
- Commission fees
- Currency conversion rates
- Research tools available
- Customer service quality
- Minimum deposit requirements

### Money Allocation Framework (4-3-3 Rule)

- **40%** → Living expenses
- **30%** → Savings (emergency fund: 3-6 months expenses)
- **30%** → Investments
- Adjust based on individual situation

### Age and Risk Tolerance

- **20s-30s**: 80-90% stocks (time to recover from losses)
- **40s-50s**: 60-70% stocks (balanced growth and protection)
- **60+**: 30-40% stocks (capital preservation)
- **Rule of thumb**: Stock % = 100 - your age

## Personal Growth Insights

### Understanding Risk Aversion

Being "extremely risk-averse" provides:

- **Short-term**: Psychological comfort, stability
- **Long-term costs**:
    - Inflation erodes cash (2-3% annually)
    - Miss market returns (7-10% annually)
    - e.g.,: $10k over 30 years → $13k (savings) vs $100k (invested)

### Balanced Risk-Taking

Not about becoming reckless, but **calibrated risk**:

- **Education** reduces fear
- Start small ($100-500)
- Separate buckets: safety (savings) + growth (investments)
- Accept that *temporary* volatility is normal

### The Path to Balanced Risk-Taking

**Not about becoming reckless**, but about **calibrated risk**:

- **Education reduces fear**: Understanding investments makes them less scary
- **Start small**: Invest $100-500 initially—small enough to lose, big enough to learn
- **Gradual exposure**: Increase investment amount as comfort grows
- **Separate buckets**:
    - Safety bucket (savings) for psychological security
    - Growth bucket (investments) for long-term wealth
- **Accept volatility**: Understand that temporary losses are normal and acceptable

### Meta-lesson: Beyond Money

Investment education develops:
- Delayed gratification
- Probabilistic thinking
- Emotional regulation
- Long-term planning

## Getting Started

### 1. Education Phase (1-2 months)

- Read basic investing books
- Understand compound interest, diversification, expense ratios
- Try paper trading

### 2. First Investment (Start small)

- Choose platform, open account
- Start with broad index fund (VOO, VT)
- Invest comfortable amount (10-20% of monthly savings)
- **Dollar Cost Averaging** **(DCA)**: Set up automatic monthly contributions to reduce risk

### 3. Monitoring & Management (Ongoing)

- Check portfolio monthly maximum (not daily)
- Rebalance annually
- Increase contributions as income grows
- Focus on **long-term growth**, ignore daily noise

---
## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Trying to time the market**: Nearly impossible, even for professionals
- **Chasing hot stocks**: Usually buying at peaks
- **Over-trading**: Generates fees, triggers taxes, usually underperforms buy-and-hold
- **Ignoring fees**: A 1% vs. 0.1% expense ratio compounds to huge differences over decades
- **Ignoring taxes**: Understanding tax-advantaged accounts matters
- **Lack of diversification**: "All my money in one tech stock"
- **Emotional decisions**: Buying high (greed), selling low (fear)
- **Complexity for complexity's sake**: Simple strategies often outperform complicated ones

---
## Final Thoughts

**The Paradox**: The optimal strategy (buy and hold diversified indices) is emotionally hardest, while emotionally satisfying approaches (active trading) usually underperform

**Success Formula**: 80% behavior, 20% knowledge

**My Advantage**: Recognizing your risk aversion and wanting to grow puts myself ahead

**Remember**: I'm not just learning to make money; I'm developing patience, discipline, and rational decision-making that will benefit every area of my life

> **Start small, stay consistent, think long-term, trust the process.**
