##  🌱 Welcome

> **Welcome to a garden that never stops growing.**

This is my **[[Digital Garden]]** — where I ***write*** what I learn, ***link*** what I know, and ***debug*** what I don’t.

Some notes are _evergreen_, some are still _seeds_ — all part of a living **[[PKM]] system** that evolves with how I think.

## 🧠 Who am I?

> By day, I build what's **reliable & impactful**. 
> By night, I explore what’s **fun & meaningful**.

Hi, I’m **Tianran** (Nature).  

I’m a **Software Engineer** based in Singapore, currently growing toward **infrastructure / platform / cloud engineering**.

### Some parts of me:

- 💻 **Programmer** — working with Prometheus, Kubernetes, Go, and building infra tools
- 🎾 **Tennis fan/player** — I obsess over the geometry of the game and ATP tour schedules
- 🧠 **Obsidian power user** — my second brain lives there
- 📒 **Journal addict** — I reflect a lot, probably too much
- 🌱 **Lifelong learner** — each note, each commit, each insight adds to the whole

I believe **consistency beats intensity**, and **notes are seeds**.  
This site is the **ecosystem** where I plant them.

## 🌍 Where do I come from?

> **I believe clarity comes from writing, not before it.**

I used to think I had to have everything figured out before putting it online. But turns out… it’s the other way around.

I started this site as a way to:
- 📚 Writing through system design, infra concepts, and distributed systems
- 🛠 Documenting my experiments, learnings, and “aha” moments
- ✍️ Publishing thoughts on how we grow — not just technically, but mentally

This garden is a record of that process.  
Nothing here is final — everything here is *becoming*.

---
## 🌻 Where am I going?

> **I’m building toward clarity, confidence, and good systems — in work and life.**

Right now, I’m:
- Deepening my systems knowledge through **real projects**
- Sharpening my thinking by **writing openly and frequently**
- Studying infra patterns, cloud-native tools, and observability practices
- Reflecting on how to grow well — in code, career, and life

I don’t expect mastery overnight.  
Like any long game — in programming or tennis — this is about **endurance, curiosity, and refinement**.

---
## 🧭 Where to start?

> **There’s no fixed path here. Explore freely — the fun’s in the *discovery*.**

- [[Garden Index]] – all the topics I’m exploring
- [[HoYoverse Project Summary|Projects]] – infra experiments & mini tools
- [[Now]] – what I’m currently focused on
- [[Meta Thinking]] – notes on PKM, Obsidian, learning, and systems of meaning
- [[Infra Notes]] – technical explorations in Prometheus, Kafka, K8s, etc.
- [[Learning to Choose -- A Late Start|Reflections]] – sometimes soft, sometimes spiky

**This garden is never finished — and neither am I.**  
Thanks for visiting 🌿
