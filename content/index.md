##  🌱 Welcome

> **Welcome to a garden that never stops growing.**

This is my **[[Digital Garden]]** — where I ***write*** what I learn, ***link*** what I know, and ***debug*** what I don’t.

Some notes are _evergreen_, some are still _seeds_ — all part of a living **[[PKM|PKM]] system** that evolves with how I think.

## 🧠 About Me

> Infra Engineer by Day, 
> Reflective Journaler by Night.

Hi, I’m **Tianran** (Nature).
I’m a **Software Engineer based in Singapore**, focusing on Cloud & Infrastructure. 

But that’s just part of the picture.

I’m also:
- 🧠 A **PKM nerd** — building my second brain in Obsidian, one linked insight at a time  
- 🎾 A **tennis player & fan** — obsessed with footwork, match geometry, and ATP/WTA tour  
- ✍️ A **reflective thinker** — I journal often, question deeply, and write to find clarity  
- 🌱 A **lifelong learner** — curious about systems, growth, and how to live intentionally  

This site is where I weave all these threads together — through notes, systems, and stories.

  What this space is, what it means to me, and why building it was hard (but worth it)

- 🤔 **[[Maps, Not Folders|How this Garden is Organized & How to Explore it]]**  
  The **design philosophy** behind my structure — folders are for storage, maps are for navigation

- 🔧 **[[How I Build this Digital Garden|How I Built this Garden]]**   
  The tech behind it: **Quartz + Obsidian**, and the lightweight publishing workflow  

- 🌱 **[[Garden Changelog|How this Garden has Grown over Time]]**
