因为发现自己在很多时间好像总是会overthink / over-complicate 然后catastrophize一些事情。然后呃总觉得就必须得想明白,或者做错一个很小的决定就会完蛋,会carry very heavy consequences,这样的话,对,但其实in reality,然后looking back就很多事情, it really doesn't matter that much, it really doesn't make a much difference, and just each choice makes sense。这样的感觉,对,就大部分情况下是这样的了,对,所以无论如何我就是想借这个机会,我记录下来一些事情, that at that moment seems like a big event, seems like a really tough decision, but over time or as I look back, just really doesn't matter at all. And yeah,所以就真的remind me of这些事情吧。然后可能也可以serve as a guide for my future choices or even when I feel more confused or纠结again
