how to rationalize some decisions? 
- current approach: to think of the "disadvantege" / misfortune of the other decision (that could have been made / the next best alternative)
	- e.g., for travel -- want to explore both places A & B (prehaps even got a preference for A), but due to some factors have to go to B -- rationalize by thinking smth bad may happen if i got to place A (bad weather, or even more extreme, like natural disaster, traffic accident...)
	- for career choice -- both company A & B seems good (but of course each has pros & cons) -- this one is so tough, yea and i really tend to idealize and fantascize over the choice that wasn't made, maginifying the pros of the unchoosed path && the cons of the current choice;  so the only thing i can think of is to maginify the cons of the unchoosed ones... but at some point i realize i can't cheat myself, but idk if that's cheating or real... then just got into the spiral and endless self blame and 患得患失, feeling extremely bad
	- or more commonly, in some chocies -- at time A i made choice A and discard choice B, but after some moment (e.g., new info), i look back and realize B is obvisouly a much better choice --> got extremely furious and regretful -- should've chosen B....


?? it doesn't work like that 

try to learn from it and move forward. If you go on beating yourself up, you are only getting in your own way now.

The only thing you can ever do is make the best decision you can at the time.

You did that - but then you got older, you got more perspective, and likely realized the decision you made had consequences you had overlooked. That’s wonderful. Now you’re better equipped when you make new choices in the future. You have improved as a person.

Life isn’t about making the right decision every time - if it were, we’d all be failures! It’s learning how to recognize good decisions so you can make them more often. And by thinking about it, it seems you’re well on your way.

This is my thought process:

Did I make a mistake? Can I undo it? No? Move on having learned something.

Is it something an apology can fix, and do I owe one? Apologize.

Did I have more than one option, and I picked the wrong one? It is done. Perhaps there were pitfalls in the other choice you don’t know about.

I’ll tell you what happens when we ruminate endlessly over something we can’t change: we get stuck. We can’t go back and change it. But if we’re in a less than desired situation because we’re so busy thinking about something and beating ourselves up for it, it is never going to get better.

Failure usually isn’t permanent. Make the best of where you’re at or change where you’re at. But beating yourself up for being human is more damaging than the original mistake.

Dust yourself off and make the best of where you’re at. **Use failure to motivate you to excel**.

> Turn / transform / channel this bad feeling into the fuel that motivates you to make better decisions later on

- the ability to imagine & transform is really quite meaningful
- just like taylor who channelled her unrequited love for Drew towards songwriting, then came the masterpiece -- teardrops on my guitar; or love at all odds, to love story (by changing the ending...)

Duality perspective

Some people have no ability for introspection so they never revisit their choices. You clearly are able to reflect on your decisions, something that can result in depth of character and immense potential for personal growth. Wondering if you did the wrong thing goes along with being introspective - it’s just the way it is! Focus on learning, growing, being more empathetic toward yourself and others. You got this!
