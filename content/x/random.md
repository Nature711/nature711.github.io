how to rationalize some decisions? 
- current approach: to think of the "disadvantege" / misfortune of the other decision (that could have been made / the next best alternative)
	- e.g., for travel -- want to explore both places A & B (prehaps even got a preference for A), but due to some factors have to go to B -- rationalize by thinking smth bad may happen if i got to place A (bad weather, or even more extreme, like natural disaster, traffic accident...)
	- for career choice -- both company A & B seems good (but of course each has pros & cons) -- this one is so tough, yea and i really tend to idealize and fantascize over the choice that wasn't made, maginifying the pros of the unchoosed path && the cons of the current choice;  so the only thing i can think of is to maginify the cons of the unchoosed ones... but at some point i realize i can't cheat myself, but idk if that's cheating or real... then just got into the spiral and endless self blame and 患得患失, feeling extremely bad
	- or more commonly, in some chocies -- at time A i made choice A and discard choice B, but after some moment (e.g., new info), i look back and realize B is obvisouly a much better choice --> got extremely furious and regretful -- should've chosen B....
