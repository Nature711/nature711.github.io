Discussion with a friend on the boundary of language 

> 用行动和体验 来代替（部分的）思考与分析

Why: the boundary of language 
- language is invented by human
- thus it can only interpret / express the experiences shared by all human beings
- some individual / private experiences are just private to an individual （独属于体验者本人）-- can't be expressed by language -- outside the boundary of language
