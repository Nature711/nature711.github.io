## 1. The Triggering Event

- Had a **deep conversation** with a former colleague during lunch

- We originally connected through **tennis**; gradually became closer through playing together

- About him:
    - Improved **extremely fast** in tennis (from beginner to comparable level within ~1 year)
    - ~10 yrs of working experiences in backend / distributed systems
    - Strong reflective ability (INTP)
        
- Last year, I gave him a handwritten Christmas letter
    - He received it very seriously
    - Explicitly expressed how moved he was（觉得我是一个很【温暖】的人）
        
- This created a strong sense of **mutual recognition**

## 2. Core Emotional Insight: Being Truly Understood

- What really touched me: 
    - Being **genuinely understood & seen**（被理解、被看见）
        
- I realized I deeply value:
    - Clear emotional feedback
    - Intellectual and reflective resonance（思维共鸣）
    - Depth over surface-level interaction（深度交流）
        
- The key experience was:    
    - Sending a signal → receiving a **clear echo**, not silence

## 3. Rethinking Self-Exploration: Beyond Pure Thinking

### His approach to self-understanding

- Uses **action and embodiment** to explore himself:
    
    - Tennis
        
    - Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
        
    - Singing
        
    - Ice skating
        
- Sees these as:
    
    - Ways of connecting mind and body
        
    - Challenging fear and physical limits
        
- Example:
    
    - BJJ as “**playing chess with the body**”
        

### My existing approach

- Heavily centered on:
    
    - Writing
        
    - Analysis
        
    - Self-reflection through language
        
- Limitations I observed:
    
    - Easy to fall into **overthinking loops**
        
    - More thinking → more confusion
        
    - Minimal behavioral breakthrough
        
    - High emotional cost, low practical value
        

### Key realization

- Self-understanding ≠ only cognitive introspection
    
- Thinking and language have **inherent limits**
    
- **Embodied experience** can bypass cognitive traps

## 4. A Major Insight on Motivation Sources

### Observing others

- Many people’s motivation comes from:
    
    - Desire to grow
        
    - Curiosity about themselves
        
    - Internal exploration
        
- Their effort feels **self-sustaining**, not forced
    

### Observing myself

- My motivation often comes from:
    
    - External stimulation
        
    - Crushes / emotional projection
        
    - Comparison with peers
        
- Pattern:
    
    - Short-term intensity
        
    - Strong but unstable
        
    - Highly dependent on uncontrollable factors
        

### Conclusion

- External motivation is not “wrong”
    
- But **over-reliance on it is not sustainable**
    
- What I want:
    
    - Shift from **external motivation → internal motivation**
        
    - Gain more agency and long-term stability

## 5. Learning Philosophy: First Principles and Anchors

### His view on tennis

- Tennis reduced to its essence:
    
    - Racket + angle + speed
        
    - Sending the ball to a spot unreachable by the opponent
        
- All other concepts expand from this:
    
    - Tactics
        
    - Positioning
        
    - Body coordination
        
    - Kinetic chain
        
    - Physics and physiology
        
- There is always a clear **anchor**
    

### My resonance with this approach

- I strongly identify with:
    
    - Understanding **why**, not just **what**
        
- I noticed I often:
    
    - Focus on making things work
        
    - Accept results without understanding principles
        
    - **Know what works but not why it works（知其然不知其所以然）**
        
- Although slower:
    
    - Principle-based understanding feels **truly mine**
        
    - More stable and transferable

## 6. Thinking Ownership in the Age of AI

### Self-doubt

- Sometimes I feel:
    
    - I’m not smart enough
        
    - Certain problems are beyond my reasoning capacity
        

### Deeper diagnosis

- The real issue may be:
    
    - Over-outsourcing thinking to AI
        
- Pattern:
    
    - Question → ask AI immediately
        
    - Fast answer, minimal internal reasoning
        
- Long-term risk:
    
    - Weakened independent thinking
        
    - Growing impatience with uncertainty
        

### New intention

- Reclaim **thinking ownership（思维主权）**
    
- Allow:
    
    - Slowness
        
    - Incomplete reasoning
        
    - Temporary confusion
        
- In the AI era:
    
    - Ordinary people use AI
        
    - Exceptional people still **think beyond AI**

`thinking ownership · AI outsourcing · independent reasoning · cognitive endurance`

## 7. Directional Shift Going Forward

- From:
    
    - External stimulation → internal drive
        
    - Pure cognition → action + experience
        
    - Fast answers → deep reasoning
        
- Goal is not instant excellence, but:
    
    - Greater autonomy
        
    - Stronger grounding
        
    - Sustainable growth

> to someone who can generate fire from within.
