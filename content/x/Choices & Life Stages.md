We make different choices as different stages of life

As we ask for advices / referencing others' choices, always make sure to include this into consideration (as part of your decision making context) 

For many choice there's no objective right / wrong; it's partially relevant to the stages of life in which you're at -- some choices are "right" at certain stages, while some are not 

This is because at different stages, our priorities & perspectives shift accordingly; as a result, different choices make sense at different stages of life; and there's no point copying others' choice without considering about the context 

And it's you who's responsible for justifying the "correctness" of your choice -- by sticking to it and making it work, or switching gears if necessary 

for example my job hunting...

## Some anchor points

- At workspace, I'm judged by my performance at work, not my appearance
- Appearance is a plus (nice-to-have), but never sufficient
- My total effort is limited -- so spend more time on the work itself and how I can improve, rather than those trivial things
