## 🧠 What Is PKM?

**Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)** is a modern label for an ancient question:

> [!quote] How do we make sense of the world?

> [!info] The Wikipedia view
> - **Knowledge Management (KM)** is about creating, sharing, and managing information.
> - **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)** is more **intimate** — it’s about making sense of _your_ world.

For me, PKM isn’t just about note-taking or productivity. It’s about **identity, values, and direction**. It raises questions like:

- What should I do in this world?
- How should I conduct myself?
- Where should I spend my limited attention?
- What truly matters?

## 🤔 Why PKM Matters

### Because We Forget — Fast

Some ideas change how we see the world. But we often forget them within hours.

> [!quote] Life is _too short_ — but for our **memories**, it’s _too long_ :)

We keep thinking we’ve “got it,” only to realize that insight fades just as fast as it came. PKM, at its best, is a tool to fight this forgetting — to _anchor_ ideas so they stay alive in our lives.

### Good PKM vs. Bad PKM

> [!danger] **Bad PKM**  
> You find something meaningful → then keep consuming → overwhelmed → the meaningful idea gets drowned out.

> [!success] **Good PKM**  
> You find something meaningful → focus on the **signal** → connect it to what you know → internalize → revisit when needed.

> In this case, more information is ***not*** more clarity. It's more ***noise***.

## 🌍 The PKM Planet

> [!note]- Visualizing PKM helps us see where we are — and how we spend our time in the world of ideas.

The **blended nature** of PKM means:

- As you connect ideas, you start writing about them.
- As you write, you often uncover insights that feed into your goals, projects, or reflections.
    
PKM isn’t one thing. It’s an ***ecosystem***.  
And to navigate it well, we need to understand the [[PKM Archetypes]] that shape how we think and work.

## 🧭 Final Thoughts

PKM isn’t just a system. It’s a mirror.  
A mirror of how we think, what we value, and how we grow.

For me, it’s not just about managing ideas —  
It’s about **becoming** someone who can live them.
